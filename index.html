    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">“Superb! Every page clearly illustrates that here is an author who not
        only writes about magick, but has obviously practiced it successfully. This book is a must for the beginner as

        plane.”</span></div>

    <div class="calibre16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Author’s Note</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">The following series of progressive lessons in magick includes an
        easy-to-understand study of the Kabalah. In keeping with Kabalistic tradition I have chosen to refer to the
        Ultimate Divinity as “God.” To both the Kabalists and myself, God is not seen as a male figure, even though God
        was described, in some instances, as anthropomorphically male. This was a symbolic convenience.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">According to the Kabalah as I’ve learned it, the Ultimate Source of
        All is unitary, having united all dualities&mdash;up and down, left and right, positive and negative, magnetic
        and electric, male and female. It is believed that God cannot be limited to being either male or female. This
        idea is discussed further within these lessons.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I agree strongly with this point of view. When I use the word “God” as
        a representative of the Single Divine Source of All, I do not wish to imply the Deity is limited to masculine or
        feminine characteristics. The use of the word “God” to represent the Divine keeps with tradition and makes the
        use of English easier.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Some readers will also notice unusual spellings of the Hebrew when
        transliterated into English and when compared to some other books. Since there is no single, agreed-upon way of
        representing the sounds of Hebrew with English, I have chosen to represent the Hebrew by the way it sounds in
        modern (Ashkenazic) Hebrew, not by archaic spellings which can only be confusing. Thus, you will find
        “Sephiroht,” the way it is pronounced by millions of people around the world today, instead of the old
        “Sephiroth.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It is hoped that this method of representing Hebrew will not offend
        anyone. Likewise, it is hoped that the usage of the term “God” for the Ultimate Divinity will not offend any
        who, like myself, values the importance of the feminine aspect of the Divine as is also described within the
        following pages.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre12"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">by Chic Cicero &amp; Sandra
            Tabatha Cicero</span></span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">What is magick? Ask a dozen people this question, and you may well get
        a dozen different answers. The subject of magick is one of those hot-button topics that triggers widely
        differing emotional reactions in people. Hollywood fantasy and horror films, while providing viewers with
        thrills and chills, have continued to disseminate half-truths and misinformation about what magick is, how it
        works, and why magicians practice it.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Magick is a process. In ancient times magick and religion were
        considered one and the same; they shared a fundamental origin and unity. Today, however, magick is often thought
        of as a distinct area of study, separate from religion. Modern magick is considered a refinement of medieval
        magick&mdash;the esoteric practices that were formulated in Europe during the era between antiquity and the
        Renaissance&mdash;practices that were created by a surplus of unemployed clergymen in medieval society. A
        Western magician practicing his craft in medieval times would have come from a Judeo-Christian background, and
        he would have thought of magick in simple terms, not in the psychological jargon that is used today. To the
        medieval magician, magick included the ancient arts of alchemy and astrology, but its most evident feature was
        working with spirits. Magickal texts of the period, known as <span class="italic">grimoires</span> (“grammars”),
        are primarily concerned with the interaction between the magician and the spirit world&mdash;an invisible world
        populated with hordes of spiritual entities: archangels, angels, planetary intelligences, elementals, and
        demons. Unlike medieval magicians, contemporary practitioners come from a wide variety of religious
        faiths&mdash;Christian, Jewish, Neo-Pagan, Wiccan, Buddhist, etc.&mdash;and yet all are able to use the
        techniques of modern magick to accomplish their goals.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Magick has its own set of attributes, mental processes, and natural or
        scientific laws, whereas religion depends more on faith, creed, and official doctrine. In short, religion is a
        specific belief or set of beliefs, values, and practices usually based on spiritual teachings. Magick is a
        method or mechanism for causing change in accordance with cosmic laws. This does not mean, however, that magick
        and faith are completely disconnected&mdash;very often they work together.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Is magick a form of miracle working, or merely an aspect of
        psychology? The most knowledgeable authorities on the subject have concluded that magick is a combination of
        both. It has been defined as “the method of science, the aim of religion.” Famed nineteenth-century occultist
        Eliphas Levi posited that magick combined “in a single science that which is most certain in philosophy with
        that which is eternal and infallible in religion.” In magick, faith and reason are not antithetical concepts;
        instead they are potent tools that, when used together, complement and empower the magician’s ceremonial
        workings. If faith and reason can be likened to “two contending forces,” then magick is the force that unites
        them. This seeming paradox is illustrated in the teachings of the Kabalah, wherein two opposing energies work
        together to power the engine we call the Universe, or as the Golden Dawn tells us, there are “Those forces
        betwixt which the equilibrium of the Universe dependeth.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Author Donald Michael Kraig has provided one of the clearest, most
        succinct definitions of magick ever written: “Magick is the science and art of causing change (in consciousness)
        to occur in conformity with will, using means not currently understood by traditional Western science . . .” In
        this case “will” is understood not in terms of the individual’s petty wants and desires, but rather as an
        intention that is in harmony with the fundamental essence of the individual’s Higher Self, and also in full
        accord with natural or cosmic law. More importantly, Kraig provides readers with a stunning revelation about the
        art of magick: magick is not supernatural&mdash;it is a completely natural phenomenon. With time, effort, and
        dedicated intent, anyone can perform acts of magick. To quote one of Kraig’s most memorable lines: “Magick is
        not something you do, magick is something you are.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Modern Magick</span> is not based upon a single
        set of teachings, although it draws upon systems as diverse as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, Solomonic
        magick, and sex magick. This book is therefore a complete and self-contained system of Western magick in its own
        right. The twelve lessons contained herein include a wealth of information on the Kabalah, creative
        visualization, the creation of talismans and ceremonial implements, magick mirrors, evocations, and much
        more.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">When we first read <span class="italic">Modern Magick</span> in 1988,
        it was obvious to us that this book was destined to become a contemporary grimoire favored by ceremonial
        magicians from many different traditions. Clearly written in an instructional step-by-step lesson format, with
        plenty of practical exercises and review quizzes at the end of every chapter, <span class="italic">Modern
          Magick</span> has become an indispensible text for any magickal library. It has sold as many copies as has
        Israel Regardie’s <span class="italic">The Golden Dawn</span>, but in a fraction of the time. Today books on
        ceremonial magick are plentiful, but very few of them can claim the title of “occult classic.” <span
          class="italic">Modern Magick</span> is one that can. And with every new edition, it only gets better.</span>

        easier. Alongside the many magickal orders and schools available to newcomers, and the even greater abundance of
        Internet resources free for the downloading, any occult bookshop worth the name has plenty of good introductory
        handbooks for the magickal beginner, and publishers bring out more every year. Still, it wasn’t always that
        way.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">When I first began studying ceremonial magick, back in the middle
        years of the 1970s, books on magick were scarce, and books on magick that were worth reading were scarcer still.
        The handful of occult publishers that existed in those days kept some of the classics in print, and every year
        brought out a few new books&mdash;some of them good, others falling at various points below that mark. Those
        books did not appear on the shelves in ordinary bookstores. To get them, I used to take an hour-long bus ride
        from the down-at-heels Seattle suburb where I lived then to the university district north of downtown.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The attraction there was a store named Beltane, which closed many
        years ago but at that time was the one really good occult bookstore in the Seattle area. I would hand over money
        I’d saved from after-school jobs for some magickal tome I’d wanted for months or years, and leaf through books I
        couldn’t afford in the hope of memorizing details I could scribble down in a notebook on the bus ride home. On
        the way, if I had enough money, I’d stop in at the handful of used book stores in town that carried occult
        books, and now and then find a treasure that became part of my slowly growing occult library. Most people who
        were learning magick in those days have similar memories.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">What made the quest for occult books so pressing was that nearly
        everything available back then accepted the magickal ethos of an earlier era, and raised steep barriers in the
        face of the eager but uninstructed novice. Many volumes on ceremonial magick were little more than publicity for
        occult orders, not all of them still extant, and whetted the reader’s appetite for magick while doing as little
        as possible to satisfy it. Many others focused entirely on magickal theory, and the handful of guides to
        magickal practice then available tended either to be cheap superficial paperbacks churned out by mass-market
        publishers, on the one hand, or daunting tomes that could have defined the opposite of “user-friendly,” if that
        phrase had been invented yet.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Those of us who pursued magickal studies outside an occult order had
        to assemble our own curriculum from hints and scraps, and it’s no exaggeration to say that many of us spent
        nearly as much time figuring out what we had to learn as we did learning it.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">That changed over the course of the 1980s. Several books played
        crucial roles in that transformation in different parts of the occult community, but for ceremonial magicians,
        the most important was the original 1988 edition of the book you are holding in your hands.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Modern Magick</span> effected a revolution in the
        way ceremonial magick was taught. In place of the vague hints, evasive language, and cryptic outlines that
        played so large a role in earlier magickal handbooks, it offered a clear and accessible guide to the basics of
        magick. An aspiring mage with no previous background at all could pick up a copy, study the teachings, practice
        the rituals and exercises, and come out the other side with a good working knowledge of the core of magickal
        theory and practice.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It’s only fair to say that plenty of figures in the occult community
        criticized <span class="italic">Modern Magick</span> in harsh terms when it first saw print. Many of those
        criticisms were founded on honest disagreements about how magick should be taught, or what practices were
        suitable for novices; magicians have always been a fractious lot, and it’s rare to find two of them who agree on
        much of anything. Some had murkier motives, rooted in the tangled ways that control over scarce information can
        be cashed in for prestige and power. The criticisms, though, did nothing to deter tens of thousands of readers
        from buying the original edition of <span class="italic">Modern Magick</span>, and turning it into one of the
        most successful magickal titles of its era.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Its impact was not limited to those it influenced directly, though.
        <span class="italic">Modern Magick</span> reset the bar for magickal textbooks, defining the approach to
        teaching magick that has become standard in the decades since its appearance. These days few occult authors can
        get away with portentous hints, skeletal outlines, and nothing more, as so many of their predecessors did;
        detailed, readable, user-friendly lessons that proceed step by step from basic principles to practical
        instructions have become essential. It’s a measure of the triumph of <span class="italic">Modern Magick</span>
        that some of those occultists who criticized it most sharply on its publication went on to produce books of
        their own that borrowed its approach to teaching the magickal arts.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In effect, <span class="italic">Modern Magick</span> did exactly what
        its title implies, and made magick modern. In a field that had been all too full of evasions and unnecessary
        secrecy, it caught the first stirrings of the information age and presented the ancient art of ceremonial magick
        in up-to-date terms. This expanded and updated third edition is a worthy successor to the original volume.
        Today’s occult newcomers will likely never know what it meant, back in the day, to find some crucial piece of
        occult lore in a dusty volume in the back of a used book shop; occult information is so abundant nowadays that
        it’s easy to treat it as a given. Still, anyone who picks up this new edition of <span class="italic">Modern
          Magick</span> can at least know one familiar experience from those days: the delight of turning the pages of
        one of the classics of modern occult literature.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">I have been privileged in the sixty odd (very odd) years of this
        incarnation to count among my friends and colleagues some of the most talented, interesting, and influential
        individuals who have ever inhaled the rarified air of modern occultism. Some, like Israel Regardie, Robert Anton
        Wilson, Phyllis Seckler, Grady McMurtry, Helen Parsons Smith, Christopher S. Hyatt, and David Wilson (a.k.a. S.
        Jason Black), have (at least for the moment) <span class="italic">shuffled off this mortal coil</span>; many
        others, I’m delighted to say, are still here and continue to bless us with their work, wisdom, and experience.
        Occupying a prominent and respected chair among this august circle of adepts is my dear friend, Donald Michael
        Kraig.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I will no doubt embarrass him with my comments. If so, I must be
        resolute and remind him that it was <span class="italic">he</span> who invited <span class="italic">me</span> to
        pen a Foreword to this new edition of his classic tome, <span class="italic">Modern Magick</span>, and that
        he’ll just have swallow (like the good boy he is) the undiluted medicine of my praise and admiration.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The measure of a magician is not to be weighed against the number of
        books he or she has written, or the amount of money amassed, or the number of fawning disciples held in tow
        (although Donald continues to earn a respectable trove of all these things). In the final analysis, the only
        meaningful credential a magician can present to the world is the <span class="italic">magician</span>. Has he or
        she evolved through the agency of magick? Is he or she a wiser, more balanced, more disciplined, more
        enlightened, more engaged, more self-aware individual? Is the individual a better friend, a better teacher, a
        better citizen, a better human being because of his or her involvement in this most personal of spiritual art
        forms? Most importantly, does the magician have the ability to laugh at <span
          class="italic">magician</span>?</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The world of magickal literature is blessed with an abundance of
        scholars and historians. Magick is, after all, an extremely colorful and fascinating subject. Unfortunately the
        field is also cursed with individuals who appear to be exploiting their photographic memories and encyclopedic
        knowledge of esoterica not as a tool of self-mastery and self-discovery, but as a vehicle in which to flee
        themselves and a life of honest self-examination&mdash;individuals who make the art of magick their <span
          class="italic">lives</span>, rather than applying the art to make their lives <span
          class="italic">magick</span>.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If I were to give the novice magician one piece of advice at the
        beginning of his or her career, it would be, “Study and practice magick, but please, have a life!” When shopping
        for instruction, avoid like the plague the pompous, pretentious, paranoid poseur, with little or no sense of
        humor&mdash;steer clear of the “master” who has no interests or vocabulary outside the confines of his or her
        self-referential magickal universe. Most especially, shun those who spend an inordinate amount of time and ink
        attacking the character and work of rival magicians, authors, teachers, and/or anyone else who would dare write
        and teach on the same subjects.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Donald Michael Kraig is the antithesis of such creatures. It is
        evident everywhere in his writing. He is profoundly secure in the knowledge of who and what he is. He gives
        generously of the knowledge and wisdom he has gained from years of study and practice. More importantly he gives
        generously of himself. In the final analysis it is all the magician has to give.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">For those who own, read, and use the first edition of <span
          class="italic">Modern Magick</span> I have some good news, some bad news, and some more good news:</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The good news is&mdash;this new edition is not just a reprint of the
        old one upon which a fancy new cover has been wrapped. It is a renovation par excellence&mdash;a <span
          class="italic">Modern Magick</span> for a new generation of adepts-to-be&mdash;a new incarnation with a
        completely reorganized format, new chapters, and nearly 40 percent new material peppered liberally with
        fascinating anecdotes from Don’s own magickal life experiences.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Foreword</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre12"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">by David F.
            Godwin</span></span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">It’s hard to say just when I became interested in ceremonial magick
        (the real thing, as opposed to magic tricks). Perhaps it had something to do with the statement of ads the
        Rosicrucians (AMORC) used to run in magazines such as <span class="italic">Mechanics Illustrated:</span>“What
        power did these men possess?” At some point I joined the now-defunct Mystic Arts Book Society, and one selection
        I received was Arthur Edward Waite’s <span class="italic">Ceremonial Magic</span>. I was basically undeterred by
        Waite’s Victorian tongue clucking over these medieval spells from resurrected grimoires, but the formulae were
        usually so involved and required so many exotic materials that any actual performance was totally
        impractical.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">When Llewellyn published <span class="italic">The Golden Dawn</span>
        by Israel Regardie, I was further enthralled, especially by his descriptions of spiritual enlightenment, which
        he referred to as the <span class="italic">summum bonum</span>, or the Pearl of Great Price. I spent years
        studying the magickal systems of this <span class="italic">fin de siècle</span> secret magickal/occult society.
        I even tentatively practiced some of the simpler rituals. Unfortunately, Regardie’s compilation consisted
        primarily of reproductions of late-nineteenth-century documents that were a bit flowery and obtuse, not composed
        with an eye to clarity but rather toward elaborate and quasi-poetic expression filled with much jargon not
        likely to be understood by non-initiates. Needless to say, fascinated or not, I never achieved much in the way
        of results.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Then came the first edition of Donald Michael Kraig’s <span
          class="italic">Modern Magick</span>.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">For the first time, the Golden Dawn system of magick began to make
        sense. Practical sense. For Donald does not just give you the mechanics, he tells you the part almost nobody had
        ever emphasized before. He tells you about the importance of <span class="italic">visualization</span>. You
        can’t just say the words. That won’t have much effect, if any, despite the instances in fiction where someone
        idly picks up a book, reads a few words, and inadvertently opens a portal to some eldritch entity. There has to
        be intent, and above all you have to <span class="italic">see</span> what is happening in your mind’s eye. The
        cabalistic cross is not just schlag-schlag-schlag-schlag along with some mumbled Hebrew; it is a cross of light
        and power surging through your body. And so with all the exercises and practices and rituals.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">After a daily practice of the “Lesser” Banishing Ritual of the
        Pentagram&mdash;or LBRP, as Donald conveniently calls it&mdash;for a couple of weeks, a light bulb exploded in
        the next room during the angelic invocation. <span class="italic">Something</span> was happening.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">And this book is not just a comprehensible rehash of Regardie and the
        Golden Dawn documents. Donald has added voluminous tidbits, information, and techniques from his own
        illuminating experience. Here is material on dreams, Tarot, exercise, and many other topics that you simply
        won’t find elsewhere. This is truly a step-by-step manual for the aspiring magician.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I learned a lot from this book. Perhaps most importantly, I learned
        the importance of the magickal attitude. After a certain amount of practice, things start to happen “in
        accordance with your will” even without ritual&mdash;so be careful what you will.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Now Mr. Kraig has given us a new edition of this seminal and
        all-important work, with added material and revisions for the sake of yet more clarity and accuracy. This book
        is a must-have for anyone with a serious interest in ceremonial magick or the Golden Dawn. It is the basic text
        of any magickal library.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Preface to the Third Edition</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">When I was asked to write a new edition of <span class="italic">Modern
          Magick</span>, I started to think back over the changes I had experienced since it was originally published. I
        tried to think back to the event that, after an amazing series of serendipitous coincidences, led to my writing
        these lessons. It wasn’t directly due to my mother teaching me to read phonetically when I was three. It wasn’t
        my fascination with reading that developed after devouring Robert A. Heinlein’s <span class="italic">Have
          Spacesuit, Will Travel</span> when I was six or seven. Nor was it my writing a twelve-page story in third
        grade when the assignment only required one page. It wasn’t my fascination with being a writer for the school
        paper that developed when I was in Daniel Webster Junior High School, either. In fact, I trace the direct
        beginning of this book to my time at UCLA.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I still remember an event during my second year. A friend and I were
        experimenting with hypnosis, and I went into a deep trance. “Why are you here?” she asked. I knew she wasn’t
        asking why I was in that room.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">From somewhere a message came to me. I blurted it out: “To learn; so I
        can teach.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Where the hell did that come from</span>? At the
        time I was attending UCLA I had no desire to be any sort of teacher. I already knew what I wanted to do. I
        wanted to make TV programs. I was hoping to get into the motion picture-television department to further my
        studies. Being logical, I also had a fallback plan: if I didn’t get into TV, I’d be a musician. I was a pretty
        good keyboardist, and had already performed all over Los Angeles, including some of the top clubs. Elliotz
        Mintz, who went on to be a publicist for John Lennon, Bob Dylan, and many others, had a TV show called <span
          class="italic">Head Shop</span>, and I had been on it with a band many times. And if not a filmmaker or
        musician, I was going to be . . . a magician! I was pretty good at that, too, having performed shows all over
        the city. I knew where I was going. <span class="italic">What happened?</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">For some unknown reason, I didn’t get into the UCLA film department.
        Musical groups I was in would have incredible success, and then get let down by managers or implode. And this
        was during a pre-Criss Angel, pre-David Blaine, pre-David Copperfield era when making a living by being a
        magician was difficult.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">So I worked as a carney. I did telephone sales. And I continued
        studying the Kabalah and occultism in general. By this time I was living in Encinitas, California, north of San
        Diego. Through a series of curious events, I ended up sharing a home with an electrical engineer and his son. He
        also studied and gave treatments in Shiatzu&mdash;Oriental massage or acupressure&mdash;when few people knew
        what it was. He started teaching it to others from our house on a street named Vulcan. I asked if I could attend
        and he told me I could. By the third time through the classes, he asked me to assist.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">One day he really surprised me. He said he had to be out of town for
        the following meeting of the class, and he wanted me to teach it. I felt very insecure, but he insisted that I
        knew enough to do it, so I agreed. He told his class, and some of the students talked with him privately, then
        came up to me. “We hear you know about the Kabalah,” one of them said. “We’d like you to teach it to us.”</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I was shocked. This was totally unexpected. I held my thumb and first
        finger an inch apart. “I only know this much,” I protested.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">He held his thumb and forefinger a fraction of an inch apart. “But we
        only know this much,” he said. So I agreed. The class was successful and people wanted to know more.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There was a nearby occult shop, and I went in and offered to teach
        classes on the Kabalah. At first it was once a week for four weeks. Over the next few years this expanded to six
        and then ten weeks. I taught it at other shops and expanded my offerings to other subjects while I continued my
        personal studies. I joined various metaphysical groups. A girlfriend dragged me to a class on Wicca. The teacher
        of that class turned out to be Raven Grimassi. I continued studying with him after that and I consider him both
        a mentor and a great friend. When my teacher of Shiatzu moved out, I had to find a new place to live. I ended up
        moving in with a person whose name I got from a card on the bulletin board of a tiny occult shop. As a result of
        that odd chance, for the next six years I shared a two-bedroom apartment with Scott Cunningham.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I continued playing in bands. I worked in occult shops and in a shop
        for stage magicians. I gave workshops. I managed a costume shop. I became a courier for a bank. I put my basic
        course on the Kabalah and magick into fifty-two brief lessons. I was going to become a master of mail order. A
        man who already had a school with metaphysical mail-order classes got in touch with me and he had me rewrite the
        fifty-two lessons into fewer, but much larger, ones. He started to distribute them, but about four months later
        he vanished.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">By this time, Scott was becoming quite a name and his success was
        inspiring. So I thought I’d give writing a book a try. I rewrote the lessons, again. That became the first
        edition of <span class="italic">Modern Magick</span>. I described what happened to me between the first two
        editions in the preface to the second edition. Since then, much has changed.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">First, contrary to what I stated in my preface to the original
        edition, the number of practicing magicians has vastly increased. I like to think that this book had something
        to do with that change. Second, the antipathy and suspicion that once existed between Pagans and ceremonial
        magicians has all but vanished. This book was one of the first that respected both paths, and again, I like to
        think that this book had something to do with that change. Third, a new tradition in magick&mdash;Chaos
        Magick&mdash;has developed. Although as of this writing it’s not very popular in the U.S.A., it has had
        incredible growth in Europe and the U.K. To keep the title of this book valid, I will be adding a new lesson
        that includes information on this and two other systems.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">My life has changed over the years, too. One by one, all of my blood
        relatives, and almost all of my relatives by my mother and grandfather’s remarriages, have left this
        incarnation. I have become honored with the title “Tarot Grandmaster” and have become deeply involved with
        hypnosis. I an now a certified hypnosis instructor and a master practitioner of Neuro-Linguistic Programming
        (NLP).</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As I told one of my NLP instructors, “This is just like what I do . .
        . only different.” That is, NLP is a form of magick that is focused on the use of the mind. Some of the first
        books on the subject were called <span class="italic">The Structure of Magic</span> (in two volumes). However,
        rather than focusing on NLP as an entirely original or unique form of magick, it is easy to incorporate many of
        its concepts to more completely and accurately explain traditional magickal concepts. In this way, incorporating
        some NLP concepts will make the magickal techniques in this book even more accessible to people today, helping
        to make the basic concepts more clear and resulting in greater success. It will make the magick more
        modern.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">When I was revising, expanding, and writing this third edition I
        referred to it as “The Platinum Edition.” Why? This is because platinum is generally worth about twice the value
        of gold. I don’t mean to imply that the words on these pages are incredibly valuable in and of themselves.
        However, if you are willing to put in the study, the practice, and the work, you will discover that what you
        learn and experience is worth many times the value of gold. This is the Platinum Edition of <span
          class="italic">Modern Magick</span> because with it you can change your life to have a value many times that
        of mere gold. The true “edition of platinum,” however, is not these lessons. If you’re willing to put in the
        study and practice required by this path, the edition of platinum will be <span
          class="italic">you</span>.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Over the years I’ve communicated with thousands of people. Some of
        them are desperate for change and ask me to do a spell or ritual for them. Respectfully, I have to refuse. If I
        were to do a magickal rite to help you, the result might help you temporarily, but it would keep you weak and
        dependent on an outside source&mdash;me&mdash;for you to reach your goals. Having people dependent upon me is
        <span class="italic">not</span> the purpose of this work. Rather, it is to help you discover true
        self-empowerment, the ability for you to achieve your goals through your own work. So do not think that if you
        have a problem you can pick up these pages and mumble through a ritual without any understanding in order to get
        amazing results. That’s what happens in the movies and comic books, not reality. You will discover that magick
        is not simply something you do, magick is something you are. It is a way of life. It is a way of approaching the
        world and the universe. It is a way to obtain what you want and need. And yes, it is a way to obtain
        power.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In fact, many people, especially when they’re younger and feel
        disempowered, come to the study of magick in an attempt to gain power over others. If that’s why you’re here,
        I’m sorry, but such a goal is not in harmony with these lessons or reality. If you follow the practices revealed
        here you will discover rather quickly that the true power of magick is power over yourself. Those who hunger for
        power over others will quickly find failure and disappointment. But with perseverance, you will find that power
        over yourself and the ability to achieve whatever you desire really is the ultimate power. It is the true power
        of <span class="italic">Modern Magick</span>.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Preface to the Second Edition</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">A great many things have happened to me since <span
          class="italic">Modern Magick</span> was originally accepted for publication. I moved my home several times,
        including moves of thousands of miles. My mother died suddenly and one of my best friends died after a long
        illness. I have traveled all over the U.S. to give lectures. I have met thousands of people and answered
        thousands of letters. I went back to school with a Fellowship to USC where I received certificates in
        multimedia, 3D graphics, animation, and Web design for the Internet.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Modern Magick</span> created major changes in my
        life. Directly and indirectly it has brought me new jobs and let me travel around the U.S. and visit Canada and
        England. Because of this book I have made many, many new friends.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Perhaps what pleases me most about the book are the many wonderful
        stories people have shared with me. I thought that <span class="italic">Modern Magick</span> would be just a
        book about how to do High Magick. Numerous people have written to me or talked to me in person to tell me that
        it changed their lives. Personally, I am more inclined to think that the people who went through major changes
        as a result of working with this book were ready to make the changes. <span class="italic">Modern Magick</span>
        was merely a kick in the direction they were already headed. But for whatever reason, I was very pleased that my
        writing has been able to help.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I had always hoped that <span class="italic">Modern Magick</span>
        would be used as a textbook for classes in magick. I have heard from many groups and individuals that they are
        using it for exactly that purpose. A bigger thrill is when I hear that groups are using it as a basis for study
        but are adding to it or changing things around. This means that people are thinking and growing. This means that
        magick is not simply the recapitulation of the actions of ancient, dead men and women, but a living and evolving
        science based upon those people’s research, dedication, genius and originality. In many ways this book is simply
        a small testament to their wisdom. I do hope that even more groups will use <span class="italic">Modern
          Magick</span> as a guide for study, research and, most importantly, practice.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Although it was only a short time ago, when I wrote this book the
        number of volumes on High Magick that had been published was limited. Even many of the most valuable and most
        popular books on the subject had been written forty years earlier. Because of the small number of ceremonial
        magicians at the time (when compared with today), I had hoped this book would enjoy continuous but relatively
        small sales. I guessed that by this time, if it stayed in print, perhaps ten thousand copies would have been
        sold. To my surprise and delight I was off by a factor of ten.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I would like to think that the acceptance of the way I presented the
        information, combined with the fact that <span class="italic">Modern Magick</span> seems to have hit the market
        at exactly the right time, has helped make ceremonial magick more understandable and more usable for a greater
        number of people than ever before. There are far more practicing ceremonial magicians today than at any time in
        history, and I feel honored to have played a small part in that expansion.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">When I first became highly active in the occult world, there was an
        attitude among ceremonial magicians and Pagans that they shouldn’t mix. I am glad to say that has changed,
        opening the world of occultism to a pragmatic eclecticism: “If it works, I’ll use it.” <span
          class="italic">Modern Magick</span> was one of the first “Pagan-friendly” books on ceremonial magick. I hope
        that it has, in some small way, contributed to the acceptance of others’ methods, bringing to Pagans and
        ceremonial magicians alike what I call “unity through diversity.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Many years ago I had a chance to go to a book signing by one of my
        favorite authors, Ursula K. Le Guin. She gave a reading from one of her novels, then started to sign books. When
        I got up to her I apologized. Everyone else had a bright, shiny, new edition of one or more of her books for her
        to sign. I presented an early edition of <span class="italic">A Wizard of Earthsea</span>, yellowing and
        obviously well read and well worn. Her entire face lit up. “I’m glad to see that somebody actually is reading my
        book,” she told me.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This happened years before <span class="italic">Modern Magick</span>
        was even written. I have learned exactly how she feels. I find it amazing when I see a well-worn copy of my book
        that is filled with notes and comments. I wish I had the time to read all of those comments and see what people
        had highlighted or underlined. I’ve heard from many people that their first or second copy of this book was so
        used that they had to get another. Some have had copies hard bound. For all of this I am grateful.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I am also grateful to all of the people I met at Llewellyn, especially
        those who helped to make this project a success. I would like to thank Carl and Sandra Weschcke for taking a
        chance on me and Nancy Mostad for helping to get this through to publication.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">And finally, I am most grateful to all of the people who have not only
        purchased this book, but have used it to help them on their individual paths to spirituality and magick. It is
        to them that I dedicate the new section of this book, the <span class="italic">Modern Magick</span> FAQ. I hope
        you find it as useful as the rest of the book.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Introduction</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Looking back now, one particular event seems so very long ago. I was
        just turning thirteen. For me, it was a period of incredible excitement. Beside school, baseball, writing
        stories, playing music, doing magic tricks, skateboarding, and a paper route, I had spent the last four years
        preparing for what I thought was going to be the most important ritual of my life. In a matter of days I was to
        have my Bar Mitzvah and be initiated into Jewish manhood. Unexpectedly one of the rabbis on the staff of my
        temple called me into his office. This rabbi looked about ninety years old . . . and acted as if he were going
        on eighteen. He even wore tennis shoes under his rabbinical robes.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">To me, Judaism had been very comfortable. No Hell or Hellfire. No “believe or be damned for
        eternity.” Just love God and follow the “Negative Golden Rule”:<div class="calibre20">
          <blockquote class="calibre21">

                    have them do the same unto you.</span></span></div>
            </div>
          </blockquote>
        </div>
        <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">To a scientifically oriented person like myself&mdash;I loved
        everything scientific and of course did the odd experiment with my Gilbert chemistry set&mdash;this was a nice,
        safe, almost secular religion&mdash;until that old rabbi called me into his office.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">He talked to me about my first responsibilities as a man within the
        Jewish community. I was overwhelmed with foreign information. Until now, this had been a virtually unknown part
        of my religion. In a few moments, that rabbi virtually blasted away my previously safe cocoon of Conservative
        Judaism.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Sure, we were supposed to wear a <span class="italic">Tallit</span>
        (prayer shawl) during certain ceremonies. It was a nice idea because, by wearing such a cloth, all were seen by
        God as being equal. (My young mind didn’t think that God could see through the cloth to riches that might be
        worn beneath.) But now I was told the Tallit was supposed to have so many threads of such-and-such colors and be
        tied in a certain number of knots. What sort of craziness was this?</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">And then there was the <span class="italic">Tephillin</span>
        (phylactery). I was supposed to participate in certain prayer rituals called a <span
          class="italic">Minyan</span> that required a minimum of ten men. (Why ten and not eleven or nine?) During the
        Minyan we were supposed to each wear the Tephillin. The one for the arm was a box with prayers in it worn only
        on the left arm with the box near the heart. It was held on by a leather strap, which was then wound seven (why
        seven?) times around the arm. Then it was to be wound around the hand so as to form the Hebrew letter Shin,
        which combined with the knot on the head straps that forms the letter Dallet and a knot on the arm strap that
        forms the letter Yud spell out the word “Shadai,” a name of God (I thought the name of God was that four-letter
        word which was never supposed to be pronounced). The other box was worn like a unicorn’s horn between and just
        above the eyes. It had two straps that would come back over the head and then over the shoulders and down in
        front. The straps of both Tephillin were finished on one side and left unfinished on the other. They had to be
        worn with the finished side showing.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Suddenly, my safe, logical religion was illogical and no longer safe.
        I needed to find out the roots of my religion and discover the basis for what appeared foolish. Thus began a
        search and study which has so far taken decades, led to the Kabalah and ritual magick, and culminates in these
        lessons which you are now beginning to study.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In those years I have studied thousands of books and searched the
        United States and Western Europe. I have written for occult and New Age magazines and papers. I received a B.A.
        in Philosophy from U.C.L.A., am a Certified Tarot Grandmaster, a certified clinical hypnotherapist, a master
        practitioner of Neuro-Linguistic Programming, and have an honorary Doctorate in Metaphysics.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The lessons that you are beginning here are not something I have
        merely dreamed up. I have taught this course dozens of times in the Southern California area to hundreds of
        students. Each time it was taught I tried to improve and refine it. It was finally partially published for the
        first time as a mail-order course. Now those lessons are being published in book form to make them more widely
        available. You have the great advantage of having the entire course written out for you in far greater detail
        than any of the notes ever taken by any of my students. I am also able to present far more information than ever
        before.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I’d like to talk a bit on what this course covers. It is, naturally,
        on ritual, ceremonial, or art magick and the Kabalah: the philosophy behind magick (and, for that matter, all
        Abrahamic religion, too). It is primarily in the tradition of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, as within
        that group developed the union of numerous aspects of the Western Mystery Tradition. This book, however, is not
        the Golden Dawn and there are many differences between what is presented here and the Golden Dawn tradition.
        Further, this book has sections drawn from many other systems, including various Eastern, Pagan, Crowleyan
        (Thelemic), and more modern systems. Some of the topics to be covered include the Tarot, divination, the history
        of the Tarot, the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, the Banishing Ritual of the Hexagram, the Middle
        Pillar Ritual, the Circulation of the Body of Light, the Watchtower Ritual, meditation, the Tree of Life, the
        Three Pillars, the four Kabalistic Worlds, the history of the Kabalah, Gematria, Notarikon, Temurah, Bible
        interpretation, talismans, astral traveling, pathworking, healing, <span class="italic">The Keys of
          Solomon</span>, magickal rituals which you can design for any purpose, sex magick, and much more.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">Obviously, this is more than can be covered in the following few hundred pages. After all,
        there are thousands of books available on these subjects, and it would be naïve to think I could capture all of
        that information in this one volume. There are, however, two things you should keep in mind:<div
          class="calibre24">
          <div class="calibre25">
            <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">1. <span class="italic">Sturgeon’s Law</span>. This law
                states that 90 percent of everything is crap. It is named in honor of science-fiction author Theodore
                Sturgeon, who used it (originally calling it “Sturgeon’s Revelation”) because he was tired of defending
                science fiction to various literary critics in the 1950s. Supposedly, after being asked if he didn’t
                agree that 90 percent of science fiction was crap, his response was that 90 percent of <span
                  class="italic">everything</span> was crap. For the discussion here, I’m simply using this law to point
                out that of those thousands of books, much is repetitive and much more is useless guessing by people who
                haven’t even tried the simplest ritual. That is, much of it really is crap. This course will leave you
                with the best of thousands of books, plus over twenty-five years of personal research and
                practice.</span></blockquote>
          </div>
          <div class="calibre25">
            <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">2. It is <span class="italic">not</span> the purpose of
                this book to completely explain all of these topics. The purpose of these pages is to introduce you to
                these ideas so that you can direct yourself in your lifelong study of the occult (remember, “occult”
                means secret, as in “secret wisdom.” It does not mean “evil”). This course will, however, give you more
                correct, immediately useful information on the Kabalah and ritual magick than any other single book or
                course presently in print. If you never read another book on magick, you will have everything you need
                to be a powerful, successful magician from the contents of these pages alone.</span></blockquote>

        <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I’d like to talk now about the Golden Dawn. At the time when this
        magickal lodge formed in the late 1880s, there were few really good books available on either magick or the
        Kabalah. Most of the really good books on these subjects that exist today were written by members of the Golden
        Dawn, people who were associated with members, or people who knowingly or unknowingly were influenced by this
        group. These people include MacGregor Mathers, Aleister Crowley, Dr. F. I. Regardie, A. E. Waite, H. P.
        Blavatsky, Dion Fortune, P. F. Case, Chic and Sandra Tabatha Cicero, John Michael Geer, and many others. Much of
        this course is derived from their writings, virtually millions of words presented here for the first time in an
        easy-to-follow, practical system of wisdom, spiritual development, and magick.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Many magickal rituals will be given in these lessons for you to
        practice. These should aid you in your psychic and magickal development. However, even though thousands of
        people throughout history have successfully shown their proficiency in magickal techniques, quite frankly I
        cannot guarantee your success. This is because the ability to perform magick successfully is dependent upon what
        you put into it. Your success is directly dependent upon the effort, practice, and consistency of your work.
        Many people, however, have told me of their great successes using the traditional techniques given in these
        pages.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The best way to use these pages is to first read through them quickly.
        Don’t worry about not understanding something. During this first reading you are simply gaining an overview of
        what is here. Then the real work begins. Start going through these lessons, page by page, studying each of the
        ideas and practicing each of the techniques as they come up. Let me make clear at the outset that this course
        will not teach “Black Magick.” You will <span class="italic">not</span> be required to do anything contrary to
        your moral or ethical values. You will not be “summoning up” any demons, devils, or evil entities.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Years ago, many Pagans, Wiccans, or Witches criticized those who
        claimed to be ceremonial magicians by saying that all they did was talk and read. They claimed that “magicians
        don’t do magick.” Unfortunately, I found myself in total agreement with them. In many cases that was true. In
        some cases today it remains true. But if you follow the instructions on the following pages, step by step, you
        will be that unique and powerful individual: a <span class="italic">practicing</span> ritual magician.</span>

    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">I want to start by telling you that all of the “fairy tales” and
        stories about the powers of wizards, witches, and magicians that you’ve heard or read all of your life are true.
        I don’t mean that as some sort of metaphoric truth, but as a truth that is as real as the floor under your feet.
        Unfortunately, the truth of those stories is only partially true. The timing and methods described in those
        stories have been altered to make them more interesting as stories rather than as the reality that is hidden
        within them. Even so, I want to make this completely clear: <span class="italic">It is absolutely and without a
          doubt possible to create spells and rituals that will bring you money, love, wisdom, contentment, and
          more!</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The key difference between the “magic” in fairy tales and in movies
        and “magick” as practiced by tens of thousands of people around the world today and in the past is that most
        real magick does not occur instantaneously. As an example, if you worked a ritual to bring you money, it may
        take a week or two for the money to arrive. When it does arrive, it would come only by natural means. But, if
        you practice and properly perform your ritual, <span class="italic">come it must!</span></span></div>

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Magick&mdash;real magick&mdash;is an experimental science. One of the
        first things a scientist learns is to keep a record of his or her work. Therefore, as part of your work as a
        magician, it is important to keep a record of your practices, experiences, thoughts, and dreams. This should be
        done in two separate records, journals, or diaries.</span></div>

      <div class="calibre19">Starting right now, today, you should start keeping a diary of your dreams. When you dream
        (and everybody does dream), one of four things may occur: <div class="calibre24">
          <div class="calibre25">

                astral work, you are learning lessons toward your spiritual, psychical, and magickal development as well
                as practicing these lessons. This occurs on what is called the “astral plane.” You will learn more about
                the Kabalistic and magickal interpretation of the astral plane in later lessons.</span></blockquote>

                Many times your unconscious mind needs to tell your conscious something, but your conscious refuses to
                or is unable to listen. In some dreams the unconscious sends a message, in symbols, to the conscious.
                This is a basis for one aspect of Freudian analysis.</span></blockquote>

    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If you have never kept a diary of your dreams, you will find that it
        is easy. Simply get a pad of paper and leave it with a pencil or pen by your bed at night. When you first wake
        up in the morning, write down what you remember. If you remember nothing, the entry in your diary may read, “I
        did not choose to remember my dreams,” and that is okay. At first you may only remember a small amount, perhaps
        only one event or feeling. Within a month of steady practice, you will have trouble keeping your entries to less
        than a page.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Also, obtain a nice blank book or binder with blank paper, lined if
        you prefer, into which you should transfer your abbreviated notes from the bedside pad. Unless your handwriting
        is very legible, print your entry from the pad of paper by your bed into the new book. This will take a little
        longer, but in years to come it will be much easier to read. Be sure to date each entry.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As an alternative, you may wish to keep a computerized dream journal.
        You should still transfer the information from your pad to the computerized journal on a daily basis. You might
        consider this your “first ritual.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In a paragraph above I wrote about reading the diary in “years to
        come.” This overview attitude is quite important. Do not, at this point, try to analyze each dream. Chances are
        at this time you will not be able to tell which of the four types of dreams mentioned earlier you are having. It
        is also unlikely that you will be able to interpret their individual meanings. Instead, look for repeated images
        or changes you find between recurring dreams or dreams with recurring themes. Please, please, <span
          class="italic">please</span> stay away from all of those ridiculous “meanings of your dreams” books!</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Let me give you an example of how this diary can be important for you.
        One of my students had frequent dreams of being chased by soldiers and running and hiding. She had dreams such
        as these several times a month, and would wake up in a cold sweat, terrified. For her, the dream was a version
        of events that actually happened to her in her early life.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">But after practicing some of the protection rituals from these
        lessons, her dreams, she told me, began to change. She no longer would hide and almost be discovered and raped.
        Instead, she would make her escape. For her, an old mental block that manifested in a fear of men and sex was
        broken down. As her feelings of security increased, her relationship with her boyfriend improved. This was
        represented by the change in her recurring dream. Similarly, you may be able to see positive changes occur in
        your life by being able to observe the changes in your dreams over time.</span></div>
    <h2 class="calibre29"><span class="calibre30">
        <span class="bold1">The Ritual or Magickal Diary</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Starting later in this lesson you will be given rituals to perform at
        least once daily. They should never take more than half an hour while you are learning them, and much less time
        when they are memorized. In a second book, or in another file on your computer, you should keep a ritual diary.
        On page 10 is a suggested format for your diary. You may wish to make copies of this page and place them in a
        binder, then simply fill one out each day or for each ritual, or set of rituals, performed.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">All of the data listed is important, and you should include
        information for each aspect every time you make an entry. In the future you will be able to see what conditions
        give you the greatest success when doing magick. Some people are most successful when they are happy and it is a
        warm night. Others have their greatest success when they are depressed and it is raining. Together, your ritual
        diary or magickal diary and dream diary become your own personal secret magickal text which is really only good
        for you.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">By “Phase of Moon” I mean full, waning, or waxing. This information
        can be obtained from a local paper or an astrological calendar such as <span class="italic">Llewellyn’s Moon
          Sign Book</span> or <span class="italic">Astrological Calendar</span>. There are also websites and computer
        applications that can provide you with this information. By “Weather Conditions” I mean rainy, cloudy, hot,
        muggy, warm, cold, etc. By “Emotions” I mean happy, sad, depressed, etc. By “Performance” I mean was it done
        well, fair, poorly, etc. By “Results” I mean how do you feel? What did you experience? Etc. You may also want to
        add comments to this section at a later date, in which case you should date the addition.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Oh, one last thing about rituals at this time. No, it is <span
          class="italic">not</span> acceptable to perform a ritual seven times in one day and forget doing them for the
        rest of the week. You may do them more often than once a day, but you should do them at least once every day.
        Regularity is important. Keep a record such as the one described for each ritual or set of rituals. If you do
        rituals in the morning, at noon, and in the evening of the same day, you’ll have three pages like the ones on
        the next page in your ritual diary.</span></div>

            <div class="calibre19">While the importance of the ritual diary cannot be underestimated, its use is
              actually very simple. You can design a page such as on the previous page on your computer and fill it in
              after performing rituals, or you can make photocopies of that page and fill a binder with them. Here’s an
              example:<div class="calibre2"><img alt="004" src="images/000015.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>

          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In the above example from my ritual diary, I used abbreviations
              for the rituals: RR is the Relaxation Ritual; LBRP is the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram; BRH is
              the Banishing Ritual of the Hexagram; TCR is the Tarot Contemplation Ritual; LBRP is a repetition of the
              Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram. You’ll learn to do all of these rituals as you study and
              practice from these lessons.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Most of the entries are pretty self-explanatory. The phase of

          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In the “Results” section, I gave my initial impression of the
              information, message, or learnings I received from the Tarot card. The follow-up was entered about two
              weeks later. It seemed to indicate the validity of the original learnings.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This particular set of rituals and learnings showed me the
              accuracy of the Tarot, even with just one card. It also helped me to work with the idea of giving up
              something for something better.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Sometimes, follow-ups can be added to entries months or even
              years after the original entries. By studying such things as effectiveness and accuracy under different
              weather, emotional, and psychological conditions, you learn when you are more effective or less effective
              in your magick. In this way, your ritual diary can become your personal magickal grimoire or book of
              shadows. Be aware, however, that those results are personal and may or may not apply to others.</span>

    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">As a result of giving these lessons many times, I realize that some of
        you may do no more than read this book. Many more people study occultism than practice it. Actually, if that’s
        what you wish to do, it is fine. The structure of these lessons is such that if you only read them, they will
        actually give information to your unconscious mind, information that will positively influence the way you think

    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">However, if you are really interested in learning how to <span class="italic">do</span>
        magick, I strongly suggest that before the seventh or eighth lesson you read at least one other
        book&mdash;preferably many more. Books are suggested in the bibliography that follows each lesson. You may
        select any of those books, or you may choose any book concerned with the Kabalah, the Tarot, or magick. The

        about the one thing which you should have in order to gain the most from this book: a Tarot deck. While this is

                There are two versions of this that I use. The first is the <span class="italic">Golden Dawn Magical
                  Tarot</span> by Chic and Sandra Tabatha Cicero. I love the brilliant colors and the accuracy of the
                imagery. The other deck is <span class="italic">The Golden Dawn Tarot</span> by Robert Wang. Although
                there are a few minor symbolic errors in it, it was the first true deck based directly on the Golden
                Dawn’s teachings. I am also not a big fan of his art. There are a couple of other decks that have been
                published claiming to be Golden Dawn decks, and you’ll have to determine if they work for you.</span>

                Case from the order. Case vowed to never produce a colored version of the deck, but this desire was
                eventually ignored by his followers. However, if you can still get the black-and-white version and the
                book that goes with the deck so you can color in the cards yourself, you will find this a very valuable

        generally far more knowledgeable and helpful than those at a general bookstore who often have no interest or
        knowledge of occult topics. Also, when you buy from local shops you keep your tax money that pays for the fire
        department, police protection, and city services right in your community. If you don’t have access to a local
        shop, many beautiful and unique decks that are suitable for this course are currently available through

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In the next column is your first ritual. Remember, it should be
        practiced at least once a day. You may have learned the ritual elsewhere. Many groups, organizations, and even
        doctors and psychological therapists teach forms of it. But although it is simple, do not underestimate its
        importance. Walking seems simple now, but it was very difficult for you to learn&mdash;and you had to learn it
        before you could learn to run. This ritual will be used to prepare for every magickal ritual in this entire

        <span class="bold1">The Relaxation Ritual</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP ONE</span>. Sit or lie in a place where you
        will not be disturbed for at least five minutes. Remember to unplug the telephone. Get comfortable. If you are
        sitting, your back should be straight. Whether sitting or lying down, your legs and arms should not be crossed.
        If sitting, rest your hands, palms down, in your lap. Remove glasses or contact lenses. Your eyes should be
        closed.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP TWO</span>. Visualize a golden ball of
        beautiful, warm light surrounding your feet. If you cannot “see” the ball of light when you visualize it, that
        is okay. Just know that it is there. Truly know that if your powers of visualization were different, you would
        be able to see it. The ball of golden warm light always brings peace and total relaxation. Wherever the ball of
        light goes, tension flows away. Let it go, and as it goes, feel your feet filled with the warm, golden glow of
        peace and total relaxation.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP THREE</span>. Now allow this ball of light
        to rise up your legs and up your torso. Then allow it to go down your arms to your fingers, and finally up your
        neck and into your head until you are completely covered with the warm, golden glow of total peace and
        relaxation, and all tension is gone. Allow the ball to move slowly. Take your time. Let go.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP FOUR</span>. With your mind, spend a few
        moments exploring your body. If you notice tension anywhere, just send the ball of light there and the tension
        will vanish. With each breath allow yourself to become more and more relaxed.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP FIVE</span>. Stay in this state of deep
        relaxation for a few moments. Know that you can return to this state whenever you like simply by doing the
        relaxation ritual. If you are having trouble sleeping, try this ritual when you lie down at night instead of
        suffering or taking dangerous pills. Be at one with yourself.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP SIX</span>. When you are ready to come out
        of this state of deep relaxation, take three deep breaths and feel fresh life and energy coming into your body
        with each breath. Let that energy flow completely through you, from the ends of your hair to the tips of your
        fingers and toes. Become aware of the world around you and breathe in life.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP SEVEN</span>. When you have returned to your
        regular awareness, record your experience in your ritual diary<span class="italic">.</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Now, before going further, spend a few days getting used to keeping
        your diaries, doing the ritual and obtaining a Tarot deck if you do not already have one that you wish to use
        with this course.</span></div>
    <h2 class="calibre29"><span class="calibre30">
        <span class="bold1">What is Magick?</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">In the first few pages we have already covered a surprising amount of
        material. We discussed dreams and ritual work, gave you a ritual to do daily, and told you how to keep a record
        of your work. This was to get you started on <span class="italic">practical work</span> as opposed to
        theoretical knowledge. The assumption was made, however, that you have a basic idea of exactly what magick is.
        But your definition may not be the same as mine, so let us now try to come to a workable definition of
        magick.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">According to the famous occultist Aleister Crowley, magick is “the
        Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with Will.” Crowley was a member of the famous Hermetic
        Order of the Golden Dawn, which was mentioned earlier. Another member of the Golden Dawn was Dion Fortune. Her
        definition of magick was the same as Crowley’s, except that she considered the “change” to be a change in
        consciousness. (Note: Fortune was a lay psychologist, someone who practiced psychology without being a medical
        doctor. She published several books on psychology under her real name, Violet Firth. Eventually, Freud felt
        there was no room for people to practice psychology without also being a doctor. The field of “lay psychology”
        dried up for many years. Today, psychiatrists [medical doctors in the field of psychology] tend to specialize in
        the use of drugs for dealing with psychological problems and disorders, while psychologists deal with such
        issues without drugs and are usually not medical doctors.)</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">But what exactly do these definitions mean? Let’s say that you do a
        magickal ritual to get fifty dollars. It, therefore, is your “Will” to get the money. You go out for a walk, and
        although when walking it is your habit to go right at a particular street corner, something makes you decide to
        turn to the left. A block down this street you meet an old friend who returns the fifty dollars you had loaned
        him several months ago.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">What made you turn left? According to Crowley’s definition, your
        magickal ritual would have caused some change in the physical world, which resulted in your turning in an
        unusual direction. Perhaps it was a smell, or a telepathic message from your friend, or from a higher entity
        telling you to “turn left!” If you ascribe to Dion Fortune’s definition, then you would say that your ritual
        made a change in your consciousness, which gave you the information to turn to the left instead of the
        right.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">In either case, three things are apparent:<div class="calibre24">
          <div class="calibre25">
            <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">1. No matter which definition you use, the actual
                result is the same.</span></blockquote>
          </div>
          <div class="calibre25">
            <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">2. The result functions <span class="italic">as
                  if</span> there had been a change in the physical world, regardless of whether there had been a change
                in the physical world or just a change in your consciousness.</span></blockquote>
          </div>
          <div class="calibre25">
            <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">3. Magick works.</span></blockquote>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">Unfortunately, either definition is still too broad. If you cause a change in conformity
        with Will and call it “magick,” then almost anything you do is a magickal act. If it is your will to open a
        door, then you turn the knob and open the door, by the above definitions you have done a magickal act. In fact,
        Crowley (his name rhymes with “holy,” not with “howdy”) says that “every intentional act is a Magickal Act.” If
        you follow his line of reasoning then, indeed, opening the door is a magickal act. While moving everything you
        do to the level of being part of your Will, and therefore magickal, has value, that idea is not what we are
        seeking at this time. For the purposes of this book, we need to make the definition of magick a bit longer:<div

              be given a gift that is just perfect for you. You might even say that it was “intended” for you. When I
              was looking for a sword to use as a magickal tool, I searched all over for one with the right design. I
              had almost given up when I saw just what I needed hanging on the wall of a martial arts studio. I asked if
              it was for sale and the man there said I’d have to ask the owner who wouldn’t be back for an hour.</span>

          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I went away and considered the situation. Well, the truth was, I

          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">An hour later I returned and met the owner and asked about the
              sword. He told me that he had brought it back from China himself. He had intended to use it for practice,
              but had never done so. (<span class="italic">Perfect</span>, I thought. <span class="italic">It was
                “virgin.”</span>) Then he said, “I wasn’t thinking of selling it, but I couldn’t let it go for anything
              less than . . . thirty-four dollars.”</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Needless to say, that’s still my magickal sword.</span></div>

      </blockquote>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">We have added the idea that the magick is accomplished by some means
        not known by modern science. A ritual that causes something to occur does not make sense to current Western
        scientific thought. Therefore, “scientists” are inclined to think that real magick, since it doesn’t fit into
        their worldview, is nothing more than supernatural hokum. But, <span class="italic">magick is not
          supernatural</span>.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Whether our entire universe came about either as the creation of an
        intelligent being or beings, or merely as the result of chance events, we still must come to the same
        conclusion: everything in the universe is natural! Some ancient cultures considered the apparent rise and fall
        of the Sun to be a supernatural event. As time passed, it was discovered that the seeming rise and fall of the
        Sun was, in fact, a natural event, caused by the rotation of the Earth.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Similarly, I am firmly convinced that one day magick will be
        understood in Western scientific terms. History proves this. Reading, writing, mathematics, astronomy,
        chemistry, medicine, physics, and more were all at one time deep occult secrets. Today, many of these things are
        taught to children before they begin school. The occultism of the past becomes the science of the future. Arthur
        C. Clarke, the famous science-fiction writer and author of <span class="italic">2001: A Space Odyssey</span>,
        wrote that “any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magick.” I totally concur.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In a sense, then, if you decide to do more than read these lessons and
        actually practice magick, you are a scientist of the future. That is why you should follow what is called “the
        scientific method.” This method tries to control all variables in experiments and keeps accurate records of
        those experiments. This is why your ritual diary is so important. It will show how variables (weather, emotions,
        etc.) affect your experiments (rituals). I cannot overstress the importance of keeping your magickal and dream
        diaries.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">We now have a definition of magick that is far more specific than
        either Crowley’s or Fortune’s. Since the results are the same, by the way, I will be dropping Fortune’s “in
        consciousness” from the definition. But the definition we have so far is still not precise enough for our
        purposes. We have to add to our definition the goal or result of the magick.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I divide magick into three categories. It is important to note that
        these categories are used in this course. Other people differ as to their definition of the different types of
        magick. Some use fewer categories, others more. Here are the descriptions of each category.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19"><span class="italic">White Magick</span>. In Eastern cultures, White Magick is known as
        yoga. When most people speak of yoga, what they really mean is Hatha Yoga. Hatha (correct pronunciation:
        “hot-ha”) Yoga involves the stretching of the body in order to prepare it for true yoga. The word “yoga” comes
        from the Sanskrit root <span class="italic">yug,</span> which means yoke or union. This “union” of true yoga is
        where you unite with, or yoke yourself to, your higher self or with God. White Magick, sometimes called
        mysticism, is the yoga of the West. Its goal has a variety of names including cosmic consciousness,
        enlightenment, the Knowledge and Conversation of your Holy Guardian Angel, realization of Self, and more. We
        will use the expression used by the Golden Dawn, which gives us the following definition of White Magick:<div

                    is the science and art of causing change to occur in conformity with will, using means not currently
                    understood by traditional Western science, for the purpose of causing either physical or
                    non-physical good to yourself or others, and is done either consciously or
                    unconsciously.</span></span></div>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Let us say that you do a spell to help a friend regain her health. By
        definition, this is Grey Magick because you are doing something for the physical good of another person.
        However, because you did the Grey Magick to help another, you end up feeling that you are closer to Divinity,
        closer to the Knowledge and Conversation of your Holy Guardian Angel. Thus, it is also White Magick.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">On the other hand, let us say that you did a ritual to obtain a
        thousand dollars. Unlike some philosophies, the traditions of magick hold that <span class="italic">there is
          nothing wrong with using magickal abilities to advance yourself in this world</span>. Yes, it is perfectly
        fine to use your magickal abilities and knowledge to get ahead on this physical plane, to get money, friends,
        love, and fame. I frequently tell people that in the West it is difficult to be spiritual when you’re wondering
        where your next meal will come from or how you will support your family. There’s nothing wrong with using magick
        to help you attain your goals. In fact, you’re encouraged to do so.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">But . . . let’s assume that after doing your ritual to obtain the
        thousand dollars your uncle dies in a car crash and leaves you a thousand dollars in his will. Yes, you have
        attained your goal, but you have done it using Black Magick; you have indirectly (or perhaps we could say
        directly) killed a person.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Some of you may even be thinking now, “Well, so what? I got the money
        I wanted.” Yes, this is true. But there is always a price to pay. “As you sow, so shall ye reap.” If you have
        caused evil, if you have been a source of spiritual darkness, it will surely return to you. In many Wiccan
        traditions it is believed that what you do will return to you threefold. Those doing Black Magick always have a
        price to pay, and sometimes that price is far heavier than expected.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I have a friend named Robin who freely admits that she used to be a
        Satanist and a black magician. She told me that she could always tell when a curse or black magick spell she had
        worked had come to fruition because something unfortunate would happen to her! This is not meant to be a lecture
        telling you that you should never do Black Magick. Rather, it is intended to show you what to expect if you try.
        Just as there is a law of gravity, so too is there an inviolable law of what is called in the East <span
          class="italic">karma</span>, and by Kabalists <span class="italic">Tikune</span> (pronounced “tee-koon”). Put
        out good and you will receive good. Put out evil, even unintentionally, and evil is what you will get. Such is
        the law.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">So how can you avoid falling into the pit of the black magician?
        First, by practicing White Magick. This is why the first part of this course is only involved in teaching White
        Magick. Do not ignore this work, as this course is cumulative. Your development as a powerful (grey) magician
        and what happens in the future in this course is dependent upon what you are doing now. Second, before doing any
        Grey Magick you should always do a divination to determine the effect and the outcome of your magick. This is a
        reason why learning the Tarot or some other divinatory system is important.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">On the pages following the next ritual you will discover meanings of
        the twenty-two Major Arcana cards of the Tarot. An “(R)” is followed by the meaning of the card if it appears to
        you during a reading in reversed (the picture is upside down) position. The meanings here are based upon the
        teachings of the occultists and Kabalists A. E. Waite and S. L. MacGregor Mathers.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">For the next few days you should become familiar with your deck and
        the definitions given here for the Major Arcana. For the time being, ignore any instruction books on the Tarot
        that you may have or which were included with the deck. Later, you can add to the system given here from
        information learned elsewhere. Using the cards for divination purposes will be explained in the next part of
        this lesson.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In the meantime, continue your diaries and the relaxation ritual, but
        after that ritual add the next ritual for daily practice, the Tarot Contemplation Ritual.</span></div>

          <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
          <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">When I first decided to learn the Tarot, I obtained a deck and
              three books on the Tarot by different authors. I figured I could take three different looks at the same
              thing and combine them into one whole. To my dismay, however, the meanings of the cards, as given by these
              authors, were radically different.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Over the years I’ve read scores of books on the Tarot. One book
              gave a listing of meanings by different authors, then gave the author’s “summary” of the meanings. His
              summaries, however, were completely unrelated to what the others had written. Another author proposed
              placing huge sheets of paper on the walls (this was written pre-spreadsheet computer applications) and
              proposed that you write the names of the seventy-eight cards across the top, then, at the left, give the
              name of an author or a book, and under each card write the meanings given by the author for that card. In
              this way you could see similarities and correspondences between the various authors and come up with your
              own meaning.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The truth is this: <span class="italic">there are no “true
                meanings” for the Tarot cards</span>. Different Tarot readers and authors give different meanings for
              the cards based on the symbolism of the cards and their own backgrounds and training.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Some people simply look at the symbols on each card and come up
              with a meaning on the spot. Others have systems based on meanings given by Tarot interpreters or other
              “authorities.” For example, I was taught a system for use with the Minor Arcana cards that is based on a
              type of numerology. Debunkers, however, consider it all junk and just broad psychological interpretations
              (I guess they never had a precise, in-depth reading).</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The curious thing is that I have taught different systems of
              meanings for the cards, and they each result in valid readings. How is that possible? Consistency. As long
              as your system is internally consistent, with practice, the cards will produce viable readings. The cards
              pulled with the meanings you have for them result in a “meaningful coincidence,” what the psychologist
              Jung called a “synchronicity.”</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">What this means, then, is that as long as you work with a system
              of meanings for the cards that is internally consistent, they will eventually produce meaningful readings.
              So there are no ultimate “true” meanings for the Tarot cards. But if your system (or systems) is
              internally consistent, they will be true for you.</span></div>

    <h2 class="calibre29"><span class="calibre30">
        <span class="bold1">The History of the Tarot&mdash;Mythical</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">In this part of the lesson I will be discussing the history of the
        Tarot and how to do a divination using the Tarot. Remember, becoming proficient in a divination system is
        necessary to prevent Grey Magick from becoming Black Magick. That is why this study is very important.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">First, though, you might wonder why you should study the Tarot and not
        some other system. Perhaps you are already familiar with the Chinese <span class="italic">I Ching</span>, tea
        leaf reading, crystal gazing, astrological prediction, runic divination, or some other system. All of these
        systems, if studied in depth and mastered, are excellent. Aleister Crowley seems to have used the <span
          class="italic">I Ching</span> far more often than the Tarot. But as you have already seen with the Tarot
        Contemplation Ritual, and will see further on, in these lessons we will be using the Tarot for reasons other
        than just divinatory purposes. And it is my belief that the more you use the Tarot in any way, the more easily
        you will become proficient in its use in all ways.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">You perhaps have heard the expression “worldview.” It is a translation
        of the German term <span class="italic">Weltanschauung</span> (pronounced “velt-ahn-sha-oong,” with the last two
        syllables run together and the final “g” almost silent) and is a concept found in German philosophy. The idea
        behind this expression is that you can have an underlying viewpoint that gives you a way to understand how
        people, our world, and the universe function and interrelate. It is a framework, lens, or filter through which a
        person sees the world. Some people have a worldview based upon politics, religion, or various psychological
        doctrines. Ritual magicians frequently have their worldview based upon the Kabalah and the Tarot. To “kick
        start” your understanding&mdash;and perhaps your adoption&mdash;of this worldview, the use of Tarot was already
        in one of the first rituals given here. As this course progresses, you will see how the Tarot plays even more
        important parts in traditional ritual magick.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There are actually two histories of the Tarot. One is factual; the
        other is made up of unproven and sometimes absurd theories. One of these unproven theories attributes an
        Egyptian heritage to the Tarot. A story of the Egyptian theory has it that Thoth, the god who functioned as the
        scribe to the other Egyptian gods, gave twenty-two pictures that illustrated great wisdom to the ancient temple
        mystery cult of Egypt. These pictures were hung on pillars in a temple underneath and between the legs of the
        famous Sphinx near the Great Pyramid of Cheops (pronounced “kee-ahps,” this is the popular Greek name of the
        pharaoh who, in ancient Egyptian, is known as Khufu, pronounced “koo-foo.” Khufu was the second pharaoh of the
        fourth dynasty who reigned from around 2589 B.C.E. to 2566 B.C.E.) on the Gizeh plateau, part of a necropolis
        that is situated on the outskirts of modern Cairo. An initiate into the mysteries would be led between the
        pillars and would have the symbolic meanings of the pictures explained to him by the initiator. From there the
        initiate would go via an underground passageway to the Great Pyramid itself, wherein he would receive full
        initiation. Unfortunately, there is no proof that this exact type of initiation ever took place.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Another story has it that a group of wise scholars, knowing that the
        famous library of Alexandria was going to be destroyed, met in the city of Fez, Morocco, to decide what to do.
        Some versions of this story say that the meeting was held after the destruction. One version of this story
        continues by saying that these scholars came from many lands and did not have a common language. Scholar-artists
        created a symbolic language with which they could communicate. The Tarot is a descendant of that artwork.
        Another version says that the wise men decided to make one great book containing all of the important wisdom of
        the world, which otherwise would be lost in the destruction of the library. In order that this great book would
        not also be destroyed, they decided to keep it hidden in the form of a gambling game, realizing that although
        humanity’s search for wisdom might die, its thirst for quick gain and its lower nature would never disappear.
        Thus, according to these stories, was the Tarot born.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Again, there is no proof that any of these stories is in any way
        factual.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There are many other stories supposedly revealing the source of the
        Tarot. Some versions say that the Tarot was brought out of Egypt by the Gypsies. Note that the word “Gypsy” is
        derived from the word “Egyptian.” This is because at one time it was believed that the Gypsies&mdash;or more
        accurately, the Romany people&mdash;came from Egypt. At that time, Egypt was thought of as being a source of all
        things mystical, magickal, and mysterious, and many Romany people did little to discourage the idea of their
        roots, adding to the mystery of their origin. Today, scholars are more inclined to think the Romany came from
        India.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Other stories, which do have a bit of possibility to them, have the
        Tarot developing out of gaming or fortunetelling systems from India or China. There is, however, no proof that
        any of these stories are true.</span></div>
    <h2 class="calibre29"><span class="calibre30">
        <span class="bold1">The History of the Tarot&mdash;Factual</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">We do have historical records of the following facts:</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">1</span>. The first mention of the Tarot was made
        in 1332 by Alphonse XI, king of Leon and Castile. He banned them along with other gambling games.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">2</span>. In 1337, Johannes, a German monk, wrote
        that they “could be used to teach morality.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">3</span>. In 1392, Charles VI of France bought
        three sets of the Major Arcana from a man named Grigonneur.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">4</span>. By the 1400s, the Italian version,
        known as the Tarocchino, had over 100 cards including the Zodiac and the so-called Christian virtues.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Although the early fourteenth century is the earliest we can date the
        beginning of the Tarot, it is 100 years later before we can positively say that the Tarot first began to appear
        in Europe (in Italy, to be precise). Of course, nothing as complex as the Tarot appears overnight, so we may
        never know the exact origins and source of the Tarot, which has predecessors in India, Persia, China, and other
        locations.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Today, although there is a “standard” deck (in its framework, if not
        in its symbolism and style), there are a wide number of variations. Similarly, several hundred years ago there
        was also a great deal of non-standardization. At least one deck had over 140 cards. Tarot decks were used for
        gambling and instruction of the young (especially those who had not been taught how to read), but by the 1800s,
        the Tarot was used almost exclusively for fortunetelling. Most decks used at this time were based upon the deck
        of Charles VI, now known as the Grigonneur deck. One variation of this deck is the Visconti pack; another is the
        Marseilles Tarot. I mention them as versions of them are still available, and some modern decks are based on the
        formats of those early decks.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn made extensive use of the Tarot,
        and as already mentioned, we will be learning some of the more esoteric uses of the Tarot later in this course.
        A. E. Waite and Pamela Colman (“Pixie”) Smith, both members of the Golden Dawn, designed what is today’s most
        popular deck, the so-called Rider-Waite (or more accurately, the Rider-Waite-Smith) Tarot. When it was first
        released in 1909, it caught on very quickly for two reasons. First, it was the first time that all of the cards
        had symbolic pictures on them. Earlier decks did not have images on the Minor Arcana cards. Second, it marked
        the first time that a Tarot deck had been simultaneously published with a book explaining how to use the deck.
        In this instance, the book was Waite’s <span class="italic">The Pictorial Key to the Tarot</span>. Of all of
        Waite’s often ponderously written tomes, I find this one of the easiest of his books to read and
        understand.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The members of the Golden Dawn considered their “correct” version of
        the Tarot to be an important secret of the Order. Waite and Smith, who had taken solemn vows not to reveal the
        inner secrets of the Golden Dawn, kept their word. Many of the cards are designed with symbolism that varies
        considerably from the meanings given to the cards by the Golden Dawn, perhaps in order to fool the
        uninitiated.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Today, there are many decks based upon Waite and Smith’s designs. More
        “original decks” (whichare actually based on Waite and Smith’s work) are popping up almost every day. And all of
        these decks, according to the Golden Dawn tradition, are symbolically wrong. However, because of their massive
        use and popularity, they have developed a validity of their own, different though it may be from the Golden Dawn
        tradition.</span></div>

          <div class="calibre16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">The Importance of Myth</span></span></div>
          <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
          <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Many people wonder why&mdash;even though we know that these
              myths of the origin of the Tarot are not historically accurate&mdash;“experts” keep repeating these myths
              as if they were true. Of course, we could simply acknowledge the obvious, that the “experts” aren’t very
              expert and don’t know what they’re talking about. And maybe the true scholars of the Tarot should be
              making more of a fuss about historical accuracy. (In fact, a few are beginning to do so.)</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">However, I actually think it is <span class="italic">more</span>
              important to have the myths than to have only the historically accurate facts. I’m not denying that we
              should research and have accurate history. But once you know a date . . . so what? The Declaration of
              Independence was signed on July 4, 1776. You now know a date. So what? Far more important than simply
              knowing a date is knowing the meaning of what occurred on that day&mdash;what that date represents.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The story of a young George Washington admitting to his father
              that he cut down the cherry tree first appeared in a biography of Washington written by an ex-parson
              turned bookseller named Mason Locke Weems. It is generally conceded today that Weems simply made up the
              story.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">But the story does several things for us, even today. It shows
              the value of honesty and integrity. In the case of the Weems’ book, first published in 1800 (a year after
              Washington’s death), it helped to establish a heroic figure as role model and part of the mythic history
              of a fledgling country. The story helped to make the myth of the man, and the mythic vision helped to make
              the nation, giving us the image of a country that stresses values including honesty and integrity. Having
              this as part of the nature of our country may have lead Alexis de Tocqueville to write in 1835&mdash;in
              contrast to what he had seen in his world travels through other countries&mdash;“America is great because
              she is good. If America ceases to be good, America will cease to be great.”</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Myths aren’t just stories. They are stories that promote values
              that people choose to follow. We learn lessons through the actions of the people in the myths rather than
              from listening to lectures from parents or parental figures. Myths of bravery, integrity, honesty, and
              justice fill our early lives and world history. The ancient myths of Ulysses and Beowulf have been
              replaced by modern myths of Captain James T. Kirk and Luke Skywalker.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The mythic histories of the Tarot tell us more about the Tarot’s
              true nature than do simple dates. They also tell us about our own natures and what we hold valuable.
              Therefore, the mythic histories of the Tarot are important not for objective historical fact, but for what
              the myths mean to me, to you, and to human civilization.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Other members of the Golden Dawn who designed Tarot decks include
        Aleister Crowley (Thoth deck), who mixed the Golden Dawn ideas with his own system of Egyptian, Sumerian, and
        Tantric occultism (plus a good dose of perverse humor), and Paul Foster Case. Case’s B.O.T.A. deck, which gives
        a version that seems halfway between the Golden Dawn deck and Waite’s deck, was the first public revelation of
        the Golden Dawn attributions of the Hebrew alphabet with the Major Arcana cards.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I know some people who claim to be occultists and who collect Tarot
        decks. Their collection, in fact, is their only claim to knowing about the occult. But some decks which they
        collect are so distant from anything which could be called “metaphysical” that I wonder about their brand of
        occultism. One deck I saw has each card drawn by a different artist. Even though it is based on the
        Rider-Waite-Smith deck, it gets so silly that it even uses popular cartoon characters on them. Another deck,
        called the <span class="italic">Tarot of the Witches</span> (certainly an insult to most if not all Witches),
        was designed for a James Bond movie. The original printing of the pack even had the famous “007” in the form of
        a pistol design on the back of the deck.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In summary, there is no proof that the Tarot came from a single
        ancient source in Egypt, China, India, or anyplace else. That they were first introduced into Europe in the
        middle of the last millennium is known, but where they originally came from is one of the great unprovable (at
        this time) mysteries of the universe.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Now, I would like to give my unprovable guess as to how the cards
        developed. It is known that both India and China did have gaming systems that, to a minor extent, resembled a
        pack of cards. Although unprovable, I maintain that it is likely that a traveler going from one of those
        countries to the Middle East, or perhaps a trader from the Middle East who went to India or China, somehow left
        one of these systems, or a version of it, in one of the Middle Eastern countries. Then, during one of the
        Crusades, a knight brought back one of these proto-decks and gave it to his lord or king, or described it and
        the ruler had one made.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Next, that lord or king, in a display of egotistical vanity (“I’ve got
        something you don’t have”) showed it to a peer, another lord or king. That second person decided to have it
        duplicated. Or, in a similar manner, the artist of one lord showed it to the artist of another lord, and the
        second artist either made a direct copy or made a version from memory. Moving from lord to lord, from king to
        king, the Tarot evolved.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There were, at that time, artist guilds that, like masons, may have
        included some form of mystical knowledge. Certainly many artists then, before then, and now were interested in
        the relationship between humanity and the divine. One of these artists could have added some mysticism in the
        Tarot art, and another could have added more. This progressed until we have the Tarot as it exists today.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">But the most important question is “Does it matter where or how the
        Tarot developed?” To this there must be a loud “NO!” in answer, for the Tarot’s use as a powerful mystical and
        magickal tool has been proven over the past several centuries.</span></div>

      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">It is important to understand the difference between fortunetelling
        and divination. Fortunetelling says that something <span class="italic">must</span> happen. Divination, such as
        with the Tarot cards, never says what must happen; it only indicates what will probably happen if you continue
        on the path you are currently traversing.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">According to this view, you have the freedom to ensure something
        happens or prevent it from occurring. You have free will and the choice is always up to you. Fortunetelling
        would say that, as an example, you will have an accident on a boat on a specific date. Divination would tell you
        that a boat trip at that time could cause problems, and you are advised to stay away from boats. You can then
        either avoid the boat trip or be extra careful when on the boat. Fortunetelling says you have no
        choice&mdash;you will be on a boat at that time and you will have an accident. Divination says you have free
        will&mdash;you can move to the desert, or at least you can stay away from boats. In these lessons we strongly
        affirm free will, not predestination.</span></div>

          <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
          <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">I am often asked which version of the Tarot is the “real” one or
              the “most accurate” or the “correct” one. Due to its popularity, the Rider-Waite-Smith deck has become the
              <span class="italic">de facto</span> standard. But is the RWS the “most correct” deck?</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Both Waite and Smith used the Golden Dawn deck. As part of their
              training, they would have had to create and use a copy of that deck. Some have even suggested that the RWS
              <span class="italic">is</span> the real Golden Dawn deck.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Of course, if you research Israel Regardie’s book, <span
                class="italic">The Golden Dawn</span>, you’ll immediately see that this is not the case. More
              importantly, even Waite admitted he was not revealing the full truth about the Tarot. In the introduction
              to his book, <span class="italic">The Pictorial Key to the Tarot</span>, Waite wrote:</span></div>
          <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">The fact remains . . . that a Secret
                Tradition exists regarding the Tarot, and as there is always the possibility that some minor arcana of
                the Mysteries may be made public with a flourish of trumpets, it will be as well to go before the event
                and to warn those who are curious in such matters that any revelation will contain only a third part of
                the earth and sea and a third part of the stars of heaven in respect of the symbolism. This is for the
                simple reason that neither in root-matter nor in development has more been put into writing, so that
                much will remain to be said after any pretended unveiling. The guardians of certain temples of
                initiation who keep watch over mysteries of this order have therefore no cause for alarm.</span></span>

          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">So if this is the case, why look at the RWS Tarot at all?</span>
          </div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The simple answer is that it works. The RWS is a great deck in
              and of itself. It needs no further justification than that. All of the numerous decks modeled on the RWS
              simply add to its success and validity.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">So is there an ultimate and perfectly correct Tarot deck? The
              answer, unfortunately, is both “yes” and “no.” There can never be a universal deck that is perfect for
              everyone because each person is a unique individual. The only deck that will be perfectly correct for you
              will be the one that, after years of practice, study, and meditation, you are inwardly urged to
              create.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Until that time, simply find a deck that follows the standard
              described earlier in this course and work with it. If you find something better later on, change and use
              it. If you come back later to the original one you liked, or change again, that’s fine.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There is really only one important choice besides that the deck
              follow the standard number of cards and divisions: it should be a deck you will use regularly.</span>

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There is another reason, a very practical reason, for doing divination
        and not fortunetelling. In many states, counties, and cities, fortunetelling for money is not legal. If you
        decide to become involved with giving readings for people and intend to charge for them, I advise calling what
        you are doing psychological counseling, divination, or, if you obtain a ministerial certificate, spiritual or
        religious counseling.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">On the following pages I will give a method for doing a divination
        using just the Major Arcana cards. I will note here that a good reading can be given using only these twenty-two
        cards. They tend to represent changing forces rather than the more static forces represented by the Minor
        Arcana. Using the Minor Arcana can give more detail, but using just the Major Arcana can give you more
        information on how things are changing or will change in your life.</span></div>

        in the center represents the final outcome of the matter under question. Here are step-by-step instructions on

        <span class="bold1">Learning the Tarot</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">The only way to learn the Tarot is to use it constantly. Try
        memorizing the meanings of the cards, one card per day. Also try giving yourself small readings on a daily
        basis. However, don’t count on the accurateness for at least a month. You were probably not too “accurate” when
        you first learned to ride a bicycle or drive a car, but as you practiced and became experienced, success in bike
        riding and driving not only was assured, it became a part of you and those skills became second nature for you.
        Today you just do them and don’t even consciously think about them. Let me assure you that with just a few weeks
        or months of committed practice, you will be successful with your readings. They will surprise you with their
        accuracy. Be sure to continue with your daily practice of the Tarot Contemplation Ritual. Doing a reading or a
        ritual does not overcome the need for doing both.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This set of lessons is not about doing divinations, it’s about
        learning the basics of practical magick. For this purpose the Major Arcana plays the most vital role. You will
        learn more of its importance later. For giving general readings to yourself and others, the Minor Arcana should
        be brought in, especially for in-depth readings. Unfortunately, there is only so much room in these lessons, and
        since the Minor Arcana does not play an intrinsic role in this course’s study of magick, a thorough study of
        them will be left to other authors. Please do not think that the Minors are unimportant. Eventually you will
        want to learn more of their meanings. In dealing with the Tarot, however, this book’s focus is limited to the
        Major Arcana.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">After studying and practicing the system explained here for at least
        two months, feel free to study the Tarot on your own. I would repeat that there is no ultimate, correct meaning
        for each card. Different authors may give different meanings to the same card. Use their ideas to add to what
        you have learned here. Some suggested books on the Tarot are listed in this lesson’s bibliography.</span></div>

    <h1 class="calibre27"><span class="calibre28"><span class="bold1">
          <span class="bold1">PART THREE</span>
        </span></span></h1>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">The High Magick art is by nature different from certain aspects of
        other so-called “primitive” forms of magick as practiced by those involved in Witchcraft, Wicca, Voodoo,
        Brujeria, etc. The word “primitive” is not meant to insult followers of those or similar traditions any more
        than calling somebody such as Grandma Moses a “primitive artist” is insulting. Rather, it infers older styles
        and simpler ways. Many people I know who are involved in Wicca and Witchcraft are proud that their tradition is
        both old and simple.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">But the very simplicity of these styles of magick has led to numerous
        books of spells and incantations, designed for the masses, which are, to a large extent, useless. The number of
        such books directly related to the Kabalistic ceremonial magickal art is small in quantity.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">One of the big differences is that for many of the “primitive”
        techniques, all that seems to be necessary is the saying of a brief incantation and the ritual manipulation of a
        few objects: burning a candle, making a Voodoo symbol or <span class="italic">vévé,</span> and so forth.
        Sometimes the spells become mutilated over time so that the meanings of the original words become lost and the
        spell becomes nothing but sounds without any sense. Although this has also happened to some extent with
        ceremonial magick, a true magician always knows the exact meaning of every word and action of a ritual. This is
        why so much training, study, and practice goes into the making of a ceremonial magician.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The actual instructions for doing the next ritual that you will learn,
        the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, will be given in the following lesson. At this point there are
        probably some of you reading this who are groaning and thinking, “But I learned that ritual years ago! Besides,
        it’s so simple.” Well, if you think it is simple, you have never done it correctly and with full knowledge. It
        is a basic ritual, but it is not simple. It is short and easy to memorize, but not simple.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">According to my dictionary, the word “basic” means “something that
        forms a base, like a basic ingredient; something that is fundamental.” I cannot overstress the fundamental
        nature of this ritual and how its practice will change your life and improve your psychic and magickal
        abilities. When <span class="italic">Modern Magick</span> was first published I had been doing it at least once
        daily for almost ten years and had no desire to stop. It is a basic, short ritual that forms the underpinnings
        to your training and will enhance your development as a true ceremonial magician.</span></div>
    <h2 class="calibre29"><span class="calibre30">
        <span class="bold1">Reasons for Performing the LBRP</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">There are three reasons for doing this ritual. The first and most
        important, yet most ethereal, is to <span class="italic">Know Yourself</span>. You will learn if you have the
        strength of will to stick to doing a ritual of this sort on a daily basis. As a result, you will discover more
        about your nature and who you are than ever before. You will develop a different feeling about yourself and your
        relationship to others and the world around you. It will affect you in many positive but subtle ways.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Second, it will expand your aura. This result is quite surprising. As
        your aura expands and brightens, you will also find yourself becoming stronger spiritually and psychologically
        than you have ever been before. This phenomenon is not imaginary. The expanded aura will enhance the feeling of
        <span class="italic">rapport</span> (pronounced “ra-pohr,” with the “a” as in the word “rasp”) others have for
        you. Rapport is a feeling of bonding between another person and you, based on their perception that you are
        trustworthy, have similar interests, are a good person, and are similar to them. Enhancing your rapport will
        result in others increasingly liking and respecting you, as well as coming to you more often for guidance and
        comfort. This won’t happen overnight, but it will happen. You will realize that this is occurring when people
        start asking you questions like, “Is that a new dress? Did you lose some weight? Did you get your hair cut?”
        even though the dress was old, your hair is the same, and you haven’t lost an ounce. Most people can
        unconsciously detect the aura and will be able to detect such a change in you. But they do not know that it is
        the aura which has changed, so they have to come up with something that they are familiar with, something on the
        physical plane such as your hair, clothes, or weight.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Third, this ritual (LBRP for short) will remove from your immediate
        area (banish) any unwanted influences. This banishing dispels negative and/or unwanted physical influences and
        non-physical ones including astral and elemental forces. This is one of the greatest defenses against psychic
        attack ever. The more you practice the LBRP, the more safe, the more at peace you will become.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The attitude you adopt when you perform this ritual is important.
        People working with computers have an expressive term: GIGO (pronounced “geegoh,” with hard “g”s). It means
        “Garbage In, Garbage Out.” If you put in garbage data, the result will be garbage, too. Put in accurate data and
        the result will be accurate. Similarly, you will get out of the ritual exactly what you put into it. Go into
        this ritual angry and you will come out of it feeling angrier. You should assume an attitude of beauty and joy.
        Doing the Relaxation Ritual immediately before the LBRP will aid you in achieving the desired state of
        consciousness.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">You should be very positive, <span class="italic">sure</span> that
        when you call on the archangels they will be there, <span class="italic">sure</span> that the pentagrams are
        really there, <span class="italic">sure</span> that you are doing the very best you possibly can.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">However, you should not “lust for results.” Focus on the ritual, not
        what you expect the result of the ritual to be. If you perform the ritual with complete concentration, <span
          class="italic">you will be successful</span>. If you concentrate on something else, such as what you expect to
        experience or what you expect as a result of the ritual, you will divide your energies (between focusing on the
        performance of the ritual and focusing on supposed results) and the ritual will decrease in its
        effectiveness.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">When you perform the ritual, you must understand that you are no
        longer in your house or apartment or building. Nor are you merely outdoors. Rather, you are in the <span
          class="italic">temple of the gods</span>. You are also in the <span class="italic">presence of
          divinity</span>. Wherever you are, when you do this ritual the area becomes a holy place. You should treat it
        as such.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Also remember that at this time you are a beginner, a student, a
        magician-in-training. You are not a high-ranking magus or wizard. Therefore, be modest, especially in the
        presence of the divine.</span></div>
    <h2 class="calibre29"><span class="calibre30">
        <span class="bold1">Physical Items for the LBRP</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">There are several physical things that you may want to use when you
        perform the LBRP. However, there is only one thing which you must have&mdash;a place where you can be alone and
        undisturbed. To do this ritual requires no more than ten minutes, and once it is memorized even less time is
        necessary. So the first thing you need to do is have a physical place where you can be sure you will be
        undisturbed for this brief length of time. For our purposes at this time, this ritual is not meant for the
        public’s eyes.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Second, it is traditional to have an altar. This can be a small table
        covered with a black cloth, or the traditional “double cube.” A good size for the traditional altar is 36 inches
        high by 18 inches square, giving an altar that is like two eighteen-inch cubes on top of one another (as above,
        so below). It also represents the earth plane because the number of sides of this altar that are external (top,
        bottom, the four sides of the upper cube, and the four sides of the lower) equal ten, the number of the Earth in
        the Kabalah (more on this later). Third, I have found that candles are much better than electric light for
        ritual work. I even prefer real candles to the wonderful, flickering LED lights that look like candles and are
        currently available very cheaply. However, those flickering, battery-powered lights are much safer, in that you
        won’t be spilling candle wax or starting an undesired fire. There are also some older bulbs for lamps that plug
        into AC wall current that have the shape of a candle flame and actually flicker. Try any and all of them out,
        and see which one or ones work best for you.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">For your work, you could have one candle for the altar, and maybe a
        few more for the room if you are doing the ritual inside. At this time use white candles. These can represent
        the purity (white) of spiritual energy (fire). Incense is also a nice touch and always adds to ritual work.
        Incense is said to represent prayers going up to God. At this point, the type of incense is not important.
        Merely find a scent that you like and use it. When I was starting, I preferred sandalwood or
        frankincense.</span></div>

        <div class="calibre19">
          <div class="calibre16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Making an Altar</span></span></div>
          <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
          <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">One of the things most ceremonial magicians learn to do is make
              things. From simple drawings to complex ritual items, taking the time to make them from scratch&mdash;or
              at least enhancing them with paint, colored glass “gems,” and other features&mdash;gives you a feeling of
              accomplishment. Further, if you focus on the purpose of the item you are creating, it gives a magickal
              charge to the item.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">You don’t have to do everything. For example, you could go to a
              lumberyard and have them cut to size the pieces of wood you would use. In this case, you’d need four
              pieces that are 18 inches by 36 inches, two pieces that are 18 inches by 18 inches, and finally finishing
              nails and glue to put it together. Tell someone at the lumberyard that you are building a cabinet and they
              can help you with instructions. The sizes will have to be adjusted due to the thickness of the
              wood.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I made my altar in a very easy way. At an unfinished wood store
              they sell cubes of press-board (also known as chipboard) that are 18 by 18 inches and have one side open.
              I simply nailed the two cubes together and added a piece of 18 by 36 inch plywood (1/2 inch thick) to
              cover the open sides of the cubes by using hinges and a magnetic latch. I have a pull in the shape of a
              majestic lion’s head that allows me to open this door.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Before nailing the two cubes together, however, I used an
              electric saw to cut out a large U shape in the bottom side of the upper cube and the top side of the lower
              cube. When nailed together, this allowed for a “pass through” between both cubes, allowing me to store
              longer items, such as long wands and swords, within the altar. By having a hinged door, rather than a
              sealed box, the altar performs double duty as both a ritual altar and a place to store ritual
              items.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Upon adding several coats of paint (even with a sealer coat,
              this type of wood seems to drink up paint), and some wheels to make the altar moveable, I was finished.
              Traditionally, the altar is painted black to represent the fact that we are far from the true spiritual
              light which comes from above, even though it is from here that we must begin our starry climb. My first
              altar, however, was painted white and had on it a beautiful figure of the Tree of Life (more on this
              figure later) and also the protective Pentagram of Solomon from the book <span class="italic">The
                Goetia</span> on the top. These came from posters that I cut to size and glued to the side and top of
              the altar. I then painted over them with several coats of lacquer. If you do this, make sure that the
              coating will dry clear. Be aware that some lacquers that claim they dry clear actually dry to a dingy
              yellowish-brown. If you decide to make an altar that is not the traditional black double cube, carefully
              consider the meaning of any symbolism, including color, which you wish to use. You may wish to use a
              standard black altar for a time, or just put a black cloth over the altar, during this period of your
              training. You can always paint it with other colors and symbols later.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Finally, be sure to put several coats of protective finish on
              the <span class="italic">top</span> of your altar. The ideal choice would be the thick coating that tables
              in nightclubs and bars often have. This way, spilled wax from candles (and trust me, sooner or later you
              <span class="italic">will</span> spill wax) is easier to clean up. Alternatively, you can get a piece of
              glass to cover the top. A decorative trim that surrounds the top of the altar and extends above the top
              edges will assure you that the glass will not slip off. If you do use such a trim, take a look at your
              altar from a distance. Does it need matching trim at the bottom? How about around the center? The choice
              is up to you.</span></div>
        </div>
      </blockquote>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There are four traditional tools or “weapons” used by ceremonial
        magicians. Details of their construction will be given in later lessons. These tools are the wand, the cup, the
        dagger, and the pentacle. You could use a paper cup to represent elemental Water, salt (instead of a pentacle)
        to represent elemental Earth, a match (instead of a wand) to represent elemental Fire, and a feather or fan
        (instead of a dagger) to represent elemental Air.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Have a symbol for each of the elements on the altar, or have none of
        them. You should not have an imbalance in the energies the tools represent. If you do have the weapons, the Air
        symbol should be on the eastern part of the altar, the Fire symbol to the south, the Water symbol to the west,
        and the Earth symbol placed to the north. If you have the tools, they should be wrapped in a piece of silk or
        cotton when they are not being used: the wand in red, the chalice in blue, the dagger in yellow, and the
        pentacle in black. Sleight-of-hand magicians’ supply shops usually have silk handkerchiefs available in these
        and other colors and shades at reasonable prices and in a variety of sizes.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">You may also wish to use a bell. This can be used for marking the
        beginning and end of the ritual, as well as marking off various sections of more complex ceremonies. How big
        should it be? What should its shape be? That’s up to you.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Another item to have is the proper clothes. Whereas some spiritual
        traditions use ritual nudity, ceremonial magick has always used special clothes. Traditionally, this is a black
        or white “Tau” robe, so called because when you hold your arms out to the side it looks like the Greek letter
        Tau. It is similar to the type of robes worn by people in choirs or angels in films. However, a robe is not
        necessary. The purpose of putting on a robe is to physically show both your conscious and your unconscious that
        you are no longer in your daily dress. It strongly shows that you are about to do something very special and
        spiritual. If you do not have access to the things needed to make or obtain a robe, simply go through your
        closet and find some clothes that you have not worn in a long time, or buy some new clothes. Wash them
        thoroughly. Now, only wear these clothes when you are going to do ritual work, and never for any other reason.
        Thus, even though they are “ordinary clothes,” they become something magickal, and you will know that when you
        put them on you are going to do something special.</span></div>

      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Robes are already available from a variety of sources, ranging from
        religious or metaphysical supply shops to school graduation suppliers. If you can sew, many sewing supply shops
        will have patterns for robes. An easy way to make such a robe is to get material that is as wide as your arms
        spread to the sides, from fingertip to fingertip. The length should be at least twice your height.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Lay the material out on the floor, folded over once. Then you should
        lay on top of the material with your neck at the fold and your feet toward the open end. Have a friend mark
        around your body in the shape of the Tau cross, with belled sleeves and a bottom that is much wider than the
        waist. The marks should be at least six to eight inches beyond your body where the arms meet your torso. Sew on
        the lines and trim off the excess material. Cut a hole for your head. Turn it inside out and try it on. You’ll
        probably need to make a hem at the bottom, around the neck opening, and at the sleeves. Traditionally, the
        sleeves should reach to your first knuckle with your arms extended. You may actually have to add material to the
        sleeves to make them long enough.</span></div>

              equivalent of pockets! You can use this to store tissues, handkerchiefs, ritual instructions, small
              magickal tools, etc.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">In the LBRP you will be making large five-pointed stars (pentagrams)
        in the air in a specific way. Your left hand should remain relaxed and at your side. If you have a knife (<span
          class="italic">not</span> the Air knife; use another dagger for the LBRP), hold it in your right hand. If not,
        make a fist and point with either the extended index (first) finger, index and middle finger together, or even
        all of the extended fingers as if the entire hand were a blade. Point outside your left hip. Draw a line up
        above your head, then move the blade to the outside of your right hip. Next, move your blade so that it is
        outside your left shoulder, then horizontally across so that it is outside your right shoulder. Finally, move it
        back to the left hip, ending exactly where you began.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Your finger(s) or the tip of the knife should always be pointing
        forward, away from you. See the diagram on this page.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">When you draw the pentagrams, you should visualize them as being a
        very bright and pure blue. It is the same color as you can see in an electric spark, the flame of a gas stove,
        or when a small dish of lighter fluid or alcohol is set ablaze. If you cannot visualize so well that you can
        actually “see” the pentagram in flame as you draw it, simply know beyond all doubt that if you had
        better-developed psychic vision you would be able to see it. <span class="italic">Know</span> that it is there.
        “See” the flame follow the tip of your blade or finger as you draw the pentagrams in the air, and know the flame
        is there.</span></div>

        here to the knowledge you already have. If this is the way you want to use these lessons, fantastic! I have a
        personal philosophy that you don’t die when you stop breathing, you die when you stop learning. If you find that

        out of your studies.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Some of you will use these lessons the way I hoped, as the best
        step-by-step introduction to magick available. That means you’ll go through each lesson and take some time
        considering everything in it, practicing the techniques, learning and actually performing the rituals regularly,
        and checking that you have mastered the information in each lesson by answering the questions in the reviews. If
        this is the way you want to use this, fantastic! If you’re using these lessons this way (and to repeat what I
        wrote earlier, I think you may find that reading throughit once, perhaps fairly quickly at the beginning of your
        studies&mdash;doing an overview&mdash;is a good idea), when you get into actually doing the work, I suggest you
        study the material of each lesson for at least one month before going on to the next lesson.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">In this part of the lesson you will receive exact instructions for
        performing the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram. Before going on in this lesson, go back and review part
        three of Lesson One. Be sure that you are totally familiar with all of the ideas in that section before
        proceeding to this section. By this time you should be familiar with keeping a dream diary and a ritual diary.

          <span class="italic1"><span class="bold1">Preliminaries</span></span>
        </span></span></h3>
    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Initial preparation of the area</span>: Start by
        determining where you will do this ritual. Give the area a good looking over. Go to the exact area where you
        will do the ritual. If you have an altar as described in the last lesson, put it in the center of your area. If
        you don’t have an altar, use any small table, a chair, a stool, or even a piece of paper on the floor. Bring in
        a chair and place it at the west of the altar, so when you sit in the chair you will be looking over the altar
        toward the east. Make sure the area is clean. Dust, vacuum, and mop as necessary. If possible, make sure there
        is room to walk in a circle around the altar and chair without knocking anything over.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Initial preparation of yourself</span>: Before
        starting the ritual you may wish to take a ritual cleansing bath. This type of bath is not intended to merely
        take the dirt off of your skin. Rather, it cleans negativity and the cares of the day from your spirit. First,
        take a shower to get the dirt off. Then run a warm bath. If you want, put some bath salts or Epsom salts with
        some nicely scented oil or perfume into the water. Then get in and just soak for a few minutes. Feel all of your
        cares, worries, and negativity going into the water. Now, pull the plug and let the water drain <span
          class="italic">while you stay in the water</span>. As the water slowly drains you will feel all of the
        negative things which were troubling you go down with the water. After all of the water has drained out of the
        tub, get out and dry yourself with a clean, fresh towel. Finally, put on your robe or special magickal
        clothes.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Final preparation of the space</span>: If you
        have them, put the four tools that represent the magickal elements on top of your altar. Remember, have all of
        them present or use none of them. Put the Major Arcana cards for the Tarot Contemplation Ritual in a pile on top
        of the altar, too. According to the diagram below, you will start the ritual between the chair and the altar,
        facing east. If you have candles for use in this ritual, now is the time to light them and turn out any electric
        lights you have burning. Of course, if it is daylight, you will want to pull the drapes or close the curtains,
        etc. If, like me, you prefer candlelight, your goal should be to have the room lit only by candles. Also, light
        any incense you wish to burn at this time.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Final preparation of yourself</span>: Take a few
        deep breaths. Inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth. Do this slowly. Let any remaining cares,
        issues, or concerns leave with each exhalation. Be aware that you are about to enter a holy place.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Sit in the chair, facing east, and do the Relaxation Ritual. Now
        stand, still facing east. Take the dagger (not the Air dagger) in your right hand, or point with your finger as
        described in the last lesson. Know that you are in the presence of God. The ritual has begun!</span></div>

          <span class="italic1"><span class="bold1">Part One: The Kabalistic Cross</span></span>
        </span></span></h3>
    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP ONE</span>. Rise from the chair and, walking
        clockwise, move around the altar to just east of it, remaining facing east (the position marked “You”).
        Visualize yourself getting larger and larger, taller and taller, until you tower above the room you are in.
        Continue this growing visualization until the city you live in is small beneath you. See the continent as tiny
        compared to your majestic body. Now even the planet Earth is small below you. However, no matter how small the
        planet Earth is, it is still firm and solid beneath your feet, anchoring you to the ground. You are completely
        safe and secure and will not float away.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Next visualize yourself growing so large that the planets of our solar
        system are like tiny toy rubber balls spinning near your feet. Soon they are too small to see as even the Milky
        Way galaxy becomes a small dot of light at your feet. Now visualize a dot of light coming from somewhere far
        above your head. Know that this is only a tiny bit of the light from this source, and if you saw the full
        brightness of this light you would immediately be blinded by its unearthly purity.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre2"><img alt="011" src="images/000086.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">This tiny bit of the endless, limitless light forms a brilliant white sphere of pulsating
        light just above your head. It is nine inches in diameter, about the size of a dinner plate. It is brighter than
        ten thousand suns, but still only a tiny portion of the source of this divine, spiritual white light. Point to
        that sphere above your head with your dagger or finger(s) . . .<div class="calibre2"><img alt="012"
            src="images/000126.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>
        <div class="calibre22"></div> . . . and “bring it down” (by pointing) to your forehead, just above and between
        the eyes. Next, visualize this brilliance filling your head with divine light. While pointing to your forehead,
        vibrate: <span class="italic">Ah-<span class="bold">TAH</span></span> . (The boldfaced syllable denotes
        emphasis. More on vibration later in this lesson.)

    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP TWO</span>. Bring the point of the dagger
        (or your finger) firmly down your body until you are pointing toward the ground. Your hand with the blade
        finishes this straight line in a position that covers your groin. As you do this, visualize the light in your
        head coming down along with the blade (or finger), forming a beam of brilliant light that moves down through

        this beam of light extend to the end of the universe, and beyond. Focus on this beam and vibrate: <span

    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP FIVE</span>. Clasp your hands at your chest
        as if praying. If you are using a dagger, the point should be up, not pointing away from you, nor to the sides
        or down. Visualize within your chest, at the point covered by your folded hands, a brilliant golden glow.
        Vibrate the words: <span class="italic">Lih-Oh-<span class="bold">LAHM</span>, Ah-<span
            class="bold">MEN</span></span>.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The meaning of this first part of the LBRP is as follows: <span
          class="italic">Ah-<span class="bold">TAH</span></span> means “you,” or, more poetically, “Thine” in Hebrew.
        The visualization given above along with the proper pointing of the dagger (or finger) is for the purpose of
        indicating that you are linking your Higher Self with the Divine. <span class="italic">Mahl-<span
            class="bold">KOOT</span></span> means “kingdom,” and according to the Kabalah refers to our physical or
        “elemental” plane and the planet Earth. That is why you should be pointing down. <span
          class="italic">Vih-G’Boo-<span class="bold">RAH</span></span> means “and the power” while <span
          class="italic">Vih-G’Doo-<span class="bold">LAH</span></span> means “and the glory.” <span
          class="italic">Lih-Oh- <span class="bold">LAHM</span></span> means “forever,” and <span
          class="italic">Ah-<span class="bold">MEN</span></span> means, of course, “amen” (but you will learn the secret
        meaning of the word “amen” in a later lesson).</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Thus, the first part of this ritual translates as “For Thine is the
        kingdom and the power and glory forever, amen.” Does this sound familiar? It should. It is part of the Lord’s
        Prayer. Curiously, this part of the Lord’s Prayer does not occur in the first instance of the prayer in the
        Bible. It does appear in a later instance, giving the impression that it was added. Is this addition evidence
        that at least some of the early Christians knew the secrets of the Kabalah? We may never know. Several of the
        words used here refer directly to the symbol of primary import in the Kabalah, the Tree of Life. This will be
        discussed later.</span></div>

          <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Although the Kabalistic Cross seems to have been originally
              introduced as part of the LBRP, it has developed a life of its own. As a result, many variations of this
              part of the ritual have developed. Here are a few of them.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">The Golden Dawn Variation</span>: In Step
              Two, members of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn folded their hands over the chest, at the point
              where the horizontal and vertical beams of light converge.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">The Crowley Variation</span>: Some
              followers of the teachings of Aleister Crowley also point to the chest, but they do so <span
                class="italic">between</span> Step One and Step Two. While at this point they add an additional name.
              Most resources give the word to be vibrated there as “Aiwass.” Aiwass, Crowley believed, was the name of
              his (Crowley’s) Holy Guardian Angel and was an extraterrestrial intelligence. Some followers simply use
              Aiwass at that point, however, it is likely that they should only use that until they contact their own
              Holy Guardian Angel, and then use the name of that entity.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">The West Coast Thelemite Variation</span>:
              Some Thelemites (followers of Crowley) on the West Coast of the U.S. believe that this ritual is related
              in some way to the famous grimoire, the <span class="italic">Goetia</span>. Crowley believed that the term
              “Goetia” meant “howling,” so the people use a type of growling or howling of the words. Unfortunately,
              it’s difficult to represent such vocalization using English. But to give you an idea, the first word,
              <span class="italic">Ah-<span class="bold">TAH</span></span>, sounds something like
              “aaaaawwwwrrrrtaaaaaaaawwwwwrrrr.”</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">The Alexandrian Variation</span>: Alex
              Sanders (1926-1988) was the founder of the Alexandrian system of Wicca, one of the earliest forms of
              Neopaganism, developed slightly later than Gardnerian Wicca. Sanders, who claimed to have been initiated
              by his grandmother, blended Gardnerian concepts with even more ceremonial magick than was used by Gardner.
              In his variation, at Step One above, instead of <span class="italic">Ah-<span
                  class="bold">TAH</span></span>, he vibrates “Kether,” and in Step Two points to the stomach.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Other variations</span>: It seems like the
              variations developed for the Kabalistic Cross are unending. I have heard some people use AUM, AUMGN or
              even a combination such as AUM-EN instead of <span class="italic">Ah-<span class="bold">MEN</span></span>.
              Those are obviously sound-alikes with some symbolic Eastern influences. One group, instead of <span
                class="italic">Ah</span>-<span class="italic"><span class="bold">TAH</span></span>, uses Ah-Tor. I have
              no idea what that means or where it came from.</span></div>

              something else. Your variation may not be the same as anyone else’s, but if it works for you, that is the
              variation you should use. As it says in Crowley’s <span class="italic">Book of the Law,</span>“Let success

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As a final note to this section, if you have not figured it out as
        yet, what you have done is to visualize yourself as the center of the universe with only the divine light coming
        through you. You may wish to remain in this position for a few minutes to feel its power.</span></div>
    <h3 class="calibre32"><span class="calibre33"><span class="italic1">
          <span class="italic1"><span class="bold1">Part Two: The Formulation of the Pentagrams</span></span>
        </span></span></h3>
    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP ONE</span>. Move forward to the easternmost
        edge of your circle. You should be at the point in first diagram labeled “East,” and the second one on the next
        page labeled “Yud-Heh-Vahv-Heh.” Face outward and away from the middle of the circle where your altar stands. In
        other words, you are at the east and facing east. Here, draw a pentagram as was described in the last lesson. Be
        sure to visualize the figure as a flaming, gas-jet blue pentagram as you draw.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP TWO</span>. Inhale through the nose. As you
        do, feel energy flow from the ends of the universe through your nose and body, and down and out of the bottoms
        of your feet to the center of the Earth. As you inhale, both hands should be raised to the sides of your head by
        your ears. The dagger (or right-hand index finger) should be pointing forward. Your left hand (which should have
        remained at your side until now) is drawn into a similar position by your left ear, the index finger pointing
        forward, the rest of the fingers closed into a fist.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP THREE</span>. Step forward with the left
        foot. At the same time thrust your hands forward so that they point to the exact middle of the glowing blue
        pentagram in front of you. (This position is known as a “God Form.” This specific form is known as “the
        Enterer.”) As you do this you should exhale and feel the energy come back up your body, out your arms and hands,
        through the center of the pentagram and to the ends of the universe. Visualize the energy as brilliant,
        fire-engine red. You should use the entire exhalation to vibrate the God name: <span
          class="italic">Yud-Heh-Vahv-Heh</span>.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP FOUR</span>. Bring your hands back to your
        ears while bringing your left foot back to its original position. Put your left hand down by your side and point
        to the center of the pentagram with your right forefinger (or dagger). Now, following the arrow in the diagram
        above, trace a line in the air at the height of the center of the pentagram as you move in a clockwise direction
        around the edge of your circle’s space. You should go 90 degrees so that you end up in the south, facing south.
        Again, see the diagram for the stopping location.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As you trace the line in the air between the pentagrams you should
        visualize a brilliant white light emanating from the tip of your finger or blade. At the south, repeat steps 1
        and 2 of this part of the ritual, but vibrate <span class="italic">Ah-Doh-<span
            class="bold">NYE</span>.</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP FIVE</span>. Repeat as above, but move to
        the west and vibrate: <span class="italic">Eh-Heh-<span class="bold">YEH</span></span>.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP SIX</span>. Repeat as above, but move to the
        north and vibrate: <span class="italic"><span class="bold">AH</span>-Glah</span>.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP SEVEN</span>. Complete the circle by
        connecting a white line from the north to the east where you began. Then, moving in the same clockwise
        direction, return to the position at the east of your altar and face east (where it says “You”). <span
          class="italic">Note:</span> If you do not have room to walk in a circle, simply pivot where you stand.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP EIGHT</span>. Now visualize the brilliant
        white circle expanding up and down to form a sphere above, below, and all around you. What you have done is
        create a sphere in brilliant white all around you with electric blue pentagrams at the quarters, which have been
        charged and sealed with names of God.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">In most major cities of the United States there are newspapers that
        are distributed free of charge (the ads pay all the costs), and they frequently have listings of events going on
        in the community. As a result of those listings early in my magickal career I twice went to see Jewish
        “scholars”&mdash;who were also rabbis&mdash;talk on the Kabalah. Perhaps things have changed since
        then&mdash;the Kabalah is becoming more popular&mdash;but I’ll probably never do that again. Both times were
        wastes and showed that these men knew nothing of the Kabalah, or at least thought so little of their audiences
        that they chose to share none of their knowledge. One even went so far as to tell his primarily Jewish audience
        to forget about the Kabalah because Jews should only believe in one God and while “the Christians have given us
        three Gods [referring to the Christian Trinity of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit], the
        Kabalists have given us ten [referring to the ten names of God on the Tree of Life].” This shows a total lack of
        understanding, which must be cleared up now. Either that or these “scholars” must explain why the most famous
        and important historical rabbis, such as Isaac Luria and the Baal Shem Tov, were “polytheistic” Kabalists. (The
        other rabbi, who came in forty-five minutes late and didn’t apologize, talked about cats in a dark alley. To
        this day I have no idea what that had to do with the Kabalah!)</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The Kabalah is a monotheistic tradition. In the Kabalah, the ultimate

        “Honey-poo”! Certainly he would take notice if his son, who had called him “Dad” for all of his life, said,
        “Father, there is something I want to talk to you about.” In the same way, there are many names for God, but
        there is only one Source of All. We can learn more about that divine Source by learning about those aspects of
        God that are available to us, that is, by tuning in to what is represented by the names of God.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">YUD-HEH-VAHV-HEH is known as the holy, ultimate, and unspeakable name
        of God. Its true pronunciation is unknown. In English we could say that it is formed of the letters Y-H-V-H.
        Jews never pronounce the word, instead saying Ah-doh-nye (or “Ha-Shem,” Hebrew for “the Name”). By placing the
        Hebrew vowels of Ah-doh-nye (which means “my lord,” not “lord” as some writers say) around the four letters that
        are known as the Tetragrammaton, the word “Yahovah” or “Jehovah” is formed. Therefore, to say God’s true
        ultimate name is either of those, or a variation shows a total misunderstanding of this holy name. “Yahveh” or
        “Yahweh” is also a misnomer, an attempt to pronounce a word with no vowels. You see, YHVH may merely be an
        abbreviation for a longer word or a code for other letters. It is possible that some of the letters of this name
        are doubled. No one knows for sure. YUD-HEH-VAHV-HEH is the English transliteration for how the Hebrew letters,
        represented by the YHVH, are named.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The Y or YUD is said to represent archetypal masculinity (the Taoist
        Yang or Jungian Animus), and the first H, called the HEH Superior, represents archetypal femininity (the Taoist
        Yin or the Jungian Anima). The V, called VAHV in Hebrew, looks like an extended YUD (there is a deep, magickal
        mystery here) and represents physical masculinity, while the last H, the HEH inferior, represents physical
        femininity. Thus, this ultimate name of God, the Tetragrammaton (Greek for “four-lettered name”), the YHVH, says
        that God is the ultimate unity, a perfect blend of all dualities (as represented by the male-female symbolism),
        a unity of all opposites, on all planes. Certainly this is not a bad notion of the essence of Divinity.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">EH-HEH-YEH is usually translated as “I am,” but is more accurately
        translated in the infinitive form of “I shall be.” It is the name God revealed to Moses at the burning bush. In
        the story, God tells Moses to go to Egypt and free the Hebrews, to which Moses asks, “Who shall I say sent me?”
        God’s response is “Eh-heh-yeh ah-share Eh-heh-yeh.” This is usually translated as “I am that I am,” which never
        made sense to me and always made me think that God was trying to be Pop-eye the Sailor. However, with the more
        accurate translation of “I shall be what I shall be” it makes perfect sense. God is saying to Moses, “I am
        beyond all names as I will be whatever I want to be.” To me, that is a profound and sensible answer from
        God.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">AH-GLAH is how the next God name is pronounced, but it is most
        commonly spelled AGLA. This is because it is an abbreviation for the words Ah-tah Gee-boor Lih-oh-lahm
        Ah-doh-nye. It means “Thou art great forever, my lord,” and is from a Hebrew prayer.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There have been several different associations between the four
        quarters, the elements, and the God names and the archangels. These four God names are the ones currently most
        associated with the directions and magickal elements of the four quarters, as are associations for the following
        archangels.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP ONE</span>. Spread your arms straight out to
        the sides, so that your body forms a cross. If you have a dagger, the point should be up. Take a second or two
        once again to feel the energies flowing through you and making you a brilliant cross of light at the center of
        the universe. The cross also represents the four archetypal elements: Air, Earth, Fire, and Water (more on these

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP TWO</span>. Visualize a figure on a hill in
        front of you. The figure is dressed in yellow robes, which have some purplish highlights. The figure carries a
        caduceus wand. (This is a symbol used by doctors: a wand entwined by serpents. It was the wand carried by
        Mercury, the Roman god of medicine and the Greek Hermes. It also represents the life force.) The figure’s robes
        wave in the wind. You should “feel” a breeze coming from behind the figure. Say: “Before me, <span

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP THREE</span>. Without turning, visualize a
        figure standing behind you, dressed in blue with some orange highlights. The figure holds a cup in the form of a
        chalice encrusted with gems and is surrounded by water-falls. Try to feel the moisture in the air. Say: “Behind

              numbers. A large part of the Kabalah, as you will find out soon, is related to numerology. The number
              three is important in the Kabalah, as it is in ancient Indian, Druidic, Christian, and other forms of
              mysticism.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Long after I wrote <span class="italic">Modern Magick</span> I
              had a realization about the God names used to charge the pentagrams. They all could be related to the
              number three. Specifically, if the pronunciation is slightly altered, they all have three
              syllables.</span></div>

              “improperly” because most of our understanding of ancient Hebrew is based on re-creations, borrowings from
              related languages and guesswork. So although it does not fit modern Hebrew norms, it could be pronounced
              with three syllables. Besides, it’s an acronym anyway and not a “real” word.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">So should you alter the pronunciations for the advantage of
              having the symbolic three syllables for each of the God names? Try it out. If it works for you, use it. If
              it doesn’t work, use the more accurate pronunciations given in these rituals.</span></div>

    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There is a physical phenomenon known as <span class="italic">harmonic
          resonance</span>. This simply means that if one object vibrates powerfully enough, another object nearby will
        start to vibrate (or resonate) with the first if the second object has a natural vibratory rate in harmony with
        the first. As an example, if a violin note is played near a piano, the piano strings that have certain harmonic
        relationships to the violin note will sound without being touched; they will start to resonate. Thus, if you can
        control the vibration rate of one object, such as yourself, you will be able to cause certain reactions in other
        objects, such as those that exist on other planes of existence. Therefore, an understanding of how to vibrate
        words is essential for a magician.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There have been some incredibly complex ideas presented as the
        “secret” of vibrating words in the Kabalah. Some involve a convoluted system of bringing the sounds, through
        visualization, to different parts of the body. While nice, I have never found any practical use for this system,
        and it makes me think that it is one of the famous sets of ridiculous additions or “blinds” that have become
        attached to magick in order to keep the secrets away from those who either don’t have a teacher or don’t want to
        study and practice.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In my experience, and the experience of my many students, there are
        two really valuable methods of vibrating words, commonly known as the two vibratory formulae. The first is an
        internal (invocatory) formula. In this formula you cause a certain part of your body (actually part of your
        astral body) to vibrate. This is exemplified in the Kabalistic Cross part of the LBRP. Let’s just look at the
        word “AH-TAH.” What you should do here is fully inhale until there isn’t room for one more drop of air. Then use
        the entire exhalation to vibrate the word. Thus, the word is elongated: AAAAHHHHHHH-TAAAAAAAHHHH. It should be
        vibrated loudly in an almost chant-like tone of voice. The pitch is usually higher than the normal pitch of your
        voice. It is almost shouted. Most importantly, you should feel it vibrate or resonate within your head.
        Likewise, MAHL-KOOT should be felt in the groin, VIH-G’BOO-RAH in the area of the right shoulder, etc.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The second vibratory method is the external (evocatory) formula. With
        this formula the intent is to excite the atmosphere (actually the so-called astral plane) around you. This is
        exemplified in the Formulation of the Pentagrams section of the LBRP. The method is quite similar to the
        invocatory formula. You inhale fully, and as you exhale you loudly vibrate the appropriate words, in this case
        God names. Here the God names are stretched out as: AAAAAAAH-HHH-GLAAAAAHHH. You should use the entire
        exhalation in sounding the God name or words when doing the evocatory vibratory formula. The big difference
        between the two formulae is that in the evocatory formula you should sense that the entire universe in front of
        you is resonating in harmony with your vibration. Your entire body and the entire universe should be experienced
        as vibrating to your call. The invocatory formula causes your body, mind, spirit, astral body, aura, etc., to
        vibrate in resonance with your voice.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There are some minor variations on these two basic formulae, such as
        seeing the words you wish to vibrate in flame before you and making the vibration charge and empower those
        flames.</span></div>
    <h2 class="calibre29"><span class="calibre30">
        <span class="bold1">The Great Voice</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Some student-magicians do not have the luxury of a place where they
        can loudly, firmly, and authoritatively vibrate the God names and words of power. In fact, they need to keep
        their work a secret. This is difficult to do if you live in an apartment with paper-thin walls!</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If you find yourself in such a position, you may use what is
        disguisedly called the “Great Voice.” That is, you may do the vibratory formulae silently or very quietly,
        perhaps at the level of a whisper or quiet conversation. However, if you do so, you must still experience the
        vibratory phenomena. You must feel the various parts of your body vibrate when doing the invocatory vibratory
        formula. You must sense the entire universe resonating in harmony to your use of the evocatory formula. In other
        words, you must have the same results whether you vibrate loudly or in the Great Voice.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If you must use the Great Voice regularly, I suggest that you find a
        place to practice using your full, loud voice several times. Find a place where you can be alone to do this.
        When everything around you seems to “change” slightly, you will know you are vibrating the words correctly.
        These changes are not physical ones, but the area will “feel” different. If you practice by using the LBRP (a
        good idea), the area will feel cleaner and fresher. Some people notice an increase in the amount of natural,
        ambient light. You may also find that you will have to adjust the pitch of your voice either up or down in order
        to make everything vibrate correctly. When you hit the pitch which is correct for you, you will know it! Your
        voice will sound much louder and more commanding, and the air will seem to be alive with crackling energy. Then
        you will know what is meant when it is said that “the voice of a true magician is an awesome thing to
        hear.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">To make a comparison, if you have ever been singing in a tile-covered
        shower stall, you will notice that your voice sounds normal, but at some pitches it suddenly booms out much
        louder and sounds fuller. That is the building literally resonating with your voice. That is the way you should
        feel when you vibrate a word.</span></div>

        </span></span></h1>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">One of the biggest fears of many occultists is “psychic attack.”
        However, the fact of the matter is that true psychic attacks are very rare. The reason they are so rare is that
        by the time a person has enough skills and talents to attack psychically, he or she also has enough mystical
        knowledge to know not to attack someone because of the negative repercussions that inevitably follow the attack.
        In the past twenty years I have had at least two hundred people ask for my help because they felt they were
        under psychic attack. I also know many metaphysical teachers and psychics who have told me of their experiences
        with people who have come to them claiming to be under psychic attack. Of the hundreds of claims of psychic
        attack of which I have heard, perhaps five cases were real while the rest were imaginary.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Be that as it may, the <span class="italic">feeling</span> of being
        under psychic attack can be a very real feeling. The unconscious mind does not know the difference between
        reality or imagination, so the feeling that you are under psychic attack can actually result in the experience
        of every symptom of such attacks. This makes the attempt to determine whether a psychic attack is actually
        coming from an outside source difficult.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Further, our <span class="italic">psyches</span> are constantly under
        attack from society: salespeople order us to buy; TV ads order us to buy; friends, family and even strangers,
        knowingly or not, try to psychologically maneuver and influence us. Whenever we are in contact with other
        people, directly or indirectly, there are almost continuous attempts being made to manipulate us. Thus, we need
        to be aware of the day-to-day attempts at subtle sorts of brainwashing we are receiving along with having the
        knowledge of what to do if a real psychic attack does occur.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Although the common belief is that a real psychic attack involves a
        trained magick worker casting a spell, the reality is that this is rarely the case. Rather, it is caused by a
        person or persons who for some reason are angry with you. Their rage causes them to unknowingly direct a stream
        of energy filled with their anger toward you. They are probably not even aware that their thoughts and emotions
        are combining to have a negative effect on you (although they might relish the idea). What is even more likely,
        however, is that you simply <span class="italic">believe</span> that some negativity is coming toward you. In
        either case, you will still feel as if you are under attack, and both cases can be dealt with in the same
        way.</span></div>

        <span class="bold1">Signs of a Psychic Attack</span>

    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Before determining that you should take action against a psychic
        attack&mdash;whether real or imagined&mdash;you will need to determine if you actually are under psychic attack.
        Several authorities give a wide selection of symptoms that indicate a psychic attack. Dion Fortune, in her
        almost paranoid <span class="italic">Psychic Self-Defense</span> , lists such things as poltergeist activity or
        feelings of fear and paranoia. Unfortunately, poltergeist activity can have numerous causes other than psychic
        attack, and fears and paranoia can be caused by false beliefs and the inability to deal with them. Some of the
        books with lists of symptoms sound depressingly similar to the claims of some Christians that demons are
        responsible for all of your problems, from smoking and weight issues to gambling and money problems.</span>

          <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Masonic lodges are frequently designed to be aligned to the four
              directions. So are some synagogues, cathedrals, Indian temples, Asian buildings, and many others. In the
              past, and in many spiritual traditions, people understood the importance of aligning with the Earth’s
              energies.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">But in most of today’s homes, such luxury is not thought about
              and may be rare. How, then, do you arrange a small room that is twelve degrees off of being truly aligned
              with the four directions? If you have some bookcases and furniture against the walls, trying to line
              things up according to the true directions leaves no room unless you remove all furniture. And even if you
              do, facing several degrees off of a corner to look at the east can feel odd and even downright weird. I’ve
              been there and done that with people, and after rituals people spend more time talking about how things
              felt “wrong” rather than spiritual effects of the ritual or other metaphysical topics.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">So what can be done? Easy. Remember, ceremonial magick, with all
              of its décor and ritual items, is still practical. It has to be focused on obtaining results. So here is
              what you can do:</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">1. If the room has any windows, use curtains and drapes so when
              you are ready to do ritual during the day, you cannot tell where the Sun is.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">2. Select one side of the room to be the “Spiritual East” and
              declare it as such. Perform the LBRP, and after the Evocation of the Archangels, and before the repetition
              of the Kabalistic Cross, say, “Before God and all the spiritual beings assembled here, I hereby declare
              that this side of the room is now, and in all future uses, the Spiritual East. So mote it be.”</span>
          </div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">From this moment on, treat that side of the room as if it were
              the east in all situations, especially during rituals.</span></div>

        doctors, parapsychologists, psychologists, and anyone who might be able to help you resolve such issues.
        Remember, the chances are they are not from a real psychic attack. Only after you have eliminated all other
        potential causes should you consider that psychic attack may be behind the situation.</span></div>

        <span class="bold1">Technique to Overcome a Psychic Attack</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">This excellent method of repelling psychic attack is derived from
        Denning and Phillips’ <span class="italic">Practical Guide to Psychic Self-Defense</span>.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP ONE</span>. Close your eyes and pivot in a
        circle until you can sense the direction from which the real or imagined stream of negative energy is coming.
        Allow your senses to spread out as you slowly turn in a circle. The feeling of energy may be slight or strong.
        It may feel hot or cold. It may vibrate or seem to have a specific color or scent that shouldn’t be there. As
        you spread out your astral senses, use them to look, feel, sense, hear, or taste something that doesn’t belong
        there. That is the direction the stream of negative energy, real or imagined, is coming from.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP TWO</span>. Once you find that direction,
        boldly face that way! The path of a magician is not one for cowards. Stand proudly and erect, and visualize on
        your forehead a bright, electric-blue pentagram with one point uppermost. Now bring your hands up to your
        forehead to surround the glowing star. The hands should be flat with the thumbs meeting at the brows and the
        fingers meeting above, palms out. Thus you have a triangle, the so-called “Triangle of Manifestation,”
        surrounding the pentagram with the thumbs as the basal line of the triangle (see figure below).</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP THREE</span>. Now take a deep breath and, as
        you exhale, step forward with your left foot and thrust your hands forward while at the same time visualizing
        the pentagram on your forehead flying out in the direction you are facing. This will have the effect of sending
        away the negativity of the real or imagined psychic attack.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP FOUR</span>. To keep it from returning set
        up a sphere of invulnerability by immediately performing the entire LBRP. (This is one of the reasons the LBRP
        should be memorized.)</span></div>

          </div>
          <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
          <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">I have often been asked, “Why not use a Mirror Spell to reverse
              a psychic attack?” A Mirror Spell is rather simple. You visualize a mirror to reflect any negative energy
              back to whoever sent it your way. There are two difficulties with this.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">First, many psychic attacks are only our own belief that we are
              under attack. They can feel real, but the energy comes from within us. So if you reflect the energy back
              to the person who sent it&mdash;you’ll be attacking yourself! Not a good idea.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It’s better to get rid of the energy rather than create an
              endless loop that sends energy back to you as a result of your unknowing self-attack, which, in turn, is
              sent back to you. Or you may think that you know who is sending it and reflect the energy to that person,
              even though he or she was not involved at all. You’ll be harming an innocent person.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The second reason is that most psychic attacks are not
              consciously directed. They are caused by a person’s anger. That attacker didn’t know what he or she was
              doing and they will face cosmic feedback (<span class="italic">karma</span> or the Kabbalistic “Ti-koon”).
              However, if you send back negative energy toward someone and are aware of what you are doing, you, too,
              will face the effects of karma. There are no “Lords of Karma” who will see that you are just returning the
              attack and you are not responsible. You are responsible for your actions, and if you act to harm
              someone&mdash;even if it is only reflecting what they sent to you&mdash;the karmic response will be the
              same as if you started the attack yourself.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Dealing with day-to-day attacks on your psyche from a multiplicity of
        sources is another matter. Doing the LBRP helps, but the problem is really one of awareness. The fact of the
        matter is that most of us are virtually unconscious&mdash;literally in a trance or asleep&mdash;for up to 95
        percent of the time we are awake. “Awakening the sleepers” was a main focus of the work of Georges Gurdjieff. I
        also urge you to read as many books as you can on psychology and Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP), as this
        information will awaken you to how the mind works and how people manipulate one another.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Magickally, another way of becoming more awake to the world around us
        involves becoming more in tune with the universe. One way to do this is to record in your magickal diary the

        four brief (less than thirty seconds each) rituals that will help attune you to the Sun as it daily traverses

              been determined that the signs given in the Adorations above are physiological representations of the four

          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In some of the original Golden Dawn documents, the position for
              midnight is given so that it looks as if you are giving the Nazi “Seig Heil!” salute. Some have claimed

          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It has been suggested by a few people that I changed the sign
              because I didn’t like the Nazi associations. That is true. However, changes like that are not uncommon.
              Originally, when boys and girls performed the “Pledge of Allegiance” in U.S. schools, they also held their
              hand out as in the Nazi salute. This wasn’t changed to the “hand over the heart” gesture until 1942. More
              importantly, some Golden Dawn temples make the sign with the flat of the hand vertical, like an archetypal
              karate chop. I have used all three methods and find the one described here to be the most effective. Try
              them all out and see which works best for you.</span></div>

        <span class="bold1">The Kabalah</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Here is the section that many of you reading these lessons for the
        first time have been waiting for: the Kabalah. Since <span class="italic">Modern Magick</span> was first
        published, the Kabalah has become a pop sensation, thanks to the participation of some Hollywood personalities.
        I wish them well, but I regret to say that some of what they are practicing has little to do with any form of
        Kabalah I have studied&mdash;and there are numerous forms or “schools” that approach the Kabalah from different
        directions.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Just as an example, the so-called “red thread” popular among some
        Kabalists is more associated with Semitic folk magick. There is nothing wrong with that; it’s just not the
        Kabalah. Similarly, selling blessed water is more along the line of what some Christian televangelists do. That
        is not a part of the Kabalah. Once, I went into one of the main locales of this supposed Kabalistic
        organization, at the “centre” of this popular revival. The first thing they tried to do was sell me a very
        expensive, multi-volume set of books. “Don’t worry if you can’t read the Hebrew or Aramaic these volumes are
        written in,” I was told. “We’ll tell you what page to look at every day and you’ll get amazing changes in your
        health and well-being just by scanning the pages with your eyes.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I left, disgusted with what they were doing. And no, I didn’t buy the
        books. So don’t worry. The study and practice of the Kabalah&mdash;I would say the <span
          class="italic">real</span> Kabalah as I know it&mdash;is not going to make you a part of some materialistic
        pseudo-religious personality cult. In fact, I would say that the more you study the Kabalah, the more likely you
        are to see through attempted manipulation and the less likely you are to fall prey to any religious cult.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In the following pages I will be discussing a brief history and some
        of the basic theories of the Kabalah. One complaint I frequently hear from many people is that the Kabalah is
        confusing or boring. In fact, it is neither. But it may take several readings of the following material to get a
        feeling for the intricacies of Kabalistic thought. Just go through the following pages at your leisure while you
        practice the daily rituals which, to repeat, includes the Relaxation Ritual, LBRP and Tarot Contemplation
        Ritual. Also work with the Four Adorations and practice the technique for overcoming real or imagined psychic
        attack so you’ll be ready if necessary. Although I have explained the Kabalah and its history hundreds of times
        in my classes, there are usually one or two people who do not immediately quite catch on to the ideas presented.
        So take a week or two practicing the rituals and perhaps making your robe and go over the following pages as
        many times as necessary.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">It is said that there were three sacred “literatures” for the ancient
        Hebrews: the Torah (which is comprised of the first five books of the Jewish Bible, sometimes called the “Old
        Testament”), the Talmud (commentaries on the Torah), and the Kabalah (mystical interpretations of the Torah and
        speculations on the nature of God and the universe). The Torah was known as “the Body of the Tradition,” and it
        was said that if ignorant people would read the Torah, they would profit from the experience. The Talmud was
        called the “Jew’s Rational Soul,” and those who were learned would profit in its study. The Kabalah was called
        the “Jew’s Immortal Spirit,” and the wise were advised to meditate upon it.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">You may have noticed that different books and authors spell the word
        “Kabalah” in different ways. This is because the word “Kabalah” comes directly from the Hebrew and there is no
        precise transliteration between English and Hebrew. Some authorities claim that Jews spell it “Kabala,” medieval
        Christian mystics spell it “Cabala,” and occultists spell it “Qabala.” If you include possible double letters
        (the “b” and the “l”) plus either having a final “h” or not, there are something like twenty-four different
        potential spellings in English for the word. I agree with the learned Rabbi Lamed Ben Clifford (my friend Lon
        Milo DuQuette) who asks in <span class="italic">The Chicken Qabalah</span> , “Is there a correct way to spell
        the word Qabalah?” He answers, “Hell no!”</span></div>
    <h2 class="calibre29"><span class="calibre30">
        <span class="bold1">Thoughts on Hebrew</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This gives me a chance to interject some thoughts concerning the
        Hebrew language. Many of the rituals in this course (such as the LBRP) will be using words from the Hebrew. But
        all languages, including Hebrew, change in their pronunciation over the centuries. As an example, the word
        “knight” that we today pronounce “nite” was originally pronounced “k-nigh-t” with a short “i” and the “gh” being
        a harsh guttural version of “ch,” as in the Scottish word “loch.” Thus, English has changed over the past few
        hundred years. Is it any wonder that Hebrew has changed over the past several thousand years?</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Turning to look at Hebrew as it is spoken today in Israel and in
        synagogues around the world (and discounting local dialects) does not help our understanding of Hebrew
        pronunciation. Modern Hebrew is not the same as Biblical Hebrew. At the beginning of the last century a man
        named Eliezer ben Yehudah came to believe that Hebrew should once again become a living language. It had been
        relegated merely to religious documents and study rooms much in the way that Latin is today. Through his
        efforts, Hebrew, like a phoenix, rose from the dead and became a living language, and was adopted as the
        language of the state of Israel. This would compare with the idea of having all people in Italy learn Latin and
        use it as their everyday tongue.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">But in the process of bringing Hebrew from death back to life, many changes in the
        language’s very nature took place:<div class="calibre24">
          <div class="calibre25">
            <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">1. Certain letters that had two different sounds no
                longer do so (see the book <span class="italic">Sepher Yetzirah</span> for a list of all the original
                double-sounding letters).</span></blockquote>
          </div>
          <div class="calibre25">
            <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">2. The Hebrew letter called the “vah” or “vahv,”
                usually having a “v” sound (although also sounding like “o” or “u”), may have originally sounded like
                our “w” and was called the “waw.”</span></blockquote>
          </div>
          <div class="calibre25">
            <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">3. Even today certain Hebrew letters can have several
                sounds. The Aleph can sound like “ah,” “eh,” or “aw.” The Yud can sound like “ee,” “ay,” or “eh.” The
                Heh can indicate “ah” or “heh.” The system of points and lines to indicate the vowels were added
                hundreds of years after Ezra compiled the Torah (circa 450-350 B.C.E.), so they may not be
                accurate.</span></blockquote>
          </div>
          <div class="calibre25">
            <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">4. Perhaps worst of all, mystically speaking, is that
                to make Hebrew a modern language, ben Yehudah had to take out much of Hebrew’s wonderful lack of
                precision. As an example, the word in Hebrew “Oh-lahm” today generally means “world.” Originally it
                seems to have meant “world,” “universe,” “aeons,” and “forever.” This showed that to the ancient Hebrew
                mind all of these things were related. Now, unfortunately, much of that knowledge is lost, as in modern
                Hebrew words are more meaning-specific.</span></blockquote>
          </div>
          <div class="calibre25">
            <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">5. Many Hebrew words were replaced by Aramaic words. As
                an example, in ancient Hebrew “Av” or “Ab” meant “father.” In modern Hebrew the word for “father” is the
                Aramaic “Abba.”</span></blockquote>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The next question is “Should we try to discover the ancient Hebrew
        pronunciation? After all, isn’t the way the words are pronounced important?” The answer is yes, the way the
        words are pronounced is important. But no, it is not worth our time to seek out the ancient pronunciation of
        Hebrew. Most of the rituals used today were really created long after Biblical Hebrew was a mere memory.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In this course, the pronunciations used are those of modern Hebrew. In
        this way you will be tapping into the energies of millions of people who speak the tongue every day, rather than
        guessing at what ancient Hebrew may have sounded like.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">After this digression, let us now return to this word of import,
        “Kabalah.” Kabalah (or Kabbalah or Qabalah or Qabbalah or Kabala or Cabala or Q.B.L., etc.) comes from the
        Hebrew word that means “to receive,” implying that the Kabalah is a “received” doctrine; that is, received from
        God. It also means that it is given by one person and received by another, usually in an oral manner. Thus, the
        true Kabalah was an oral, secret tradition, which for thousands of years was jealously guarded from the
        profane.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Like the Tarot, there are two types of histories of the Kabalah. The
        first given here is a mythological history, the second is the known, factual history.</span></div>
    <h2 class="calibre29"><span class="calibre30">
        <span class="bold1">The History of the Kabalah&mdash;Mythical</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">The Kabalah was a secret science known to the angels and to God before
        the creation of the universe. After Adam and Eve fell from grace in the Garden of Eden, an angel taught the
        wisdom to Adam so that grace and purity might be regained. (I notice similarities here between this story and
        that of Prometheus, who brought fire or “divine wisdom” to the human race. I wonder which story came first or if
        both are reinterpretations of earlier myths?) This knowledge Adam passed on to his sons, but was later forgotten
        or lost.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">After the deluge, God not only gave the rainbow as a sign of his
        covenant with humanity, but also instructed Noah and his sons in the secret knowledge. But, as before, the
        knowledge was eventually forgotten or lost.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">You may by now be seeing a trend developing for the reception and loss
        of this secret knowledge. Angels instructed Abraham in the wisdom. He, in turn, instructed Isaac and from there
        it went to Jacob. But during the captivity in Egypt it was again lost.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The knowledge was next recovered by Moses. Moses, so the story goes,
        spent forty days on the top of Mount Sinai, and traditionalists wish us to believe that all he obtained from God
        was two stone tablets with the Decalogue (Ten Commandments) on them. The mystical interpretation is that the
        first time Moses went up he received the secrets of the Kabalah from God, but destroyed them upon his return and
        seeing the people involved in idol worship. He returned to the top of the mountain, but now God would not allow
        Moses to share the secrets of the Kabalah with the common people. Instead, like little children (the name
        “Children of Israel” is very appropriate in this context) they were told what they could and could not do in the
        form of the Ten Commandments and the other 603 laws of the Torah. Moses, who already had received the Kabalah,
        was told that he could only give the secrets to his brother Aaron and through him to the future high priests of
        the Hebrews.</span></div>

          <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
          <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">I think that this would be a good time to share a small tale of
              my personal history. Before I was born, my father decided to change the family name. You see, the family
              name had been “Katz.” My father, Marvin Pershing Katz, had been a high school and college football hero.
              He was known as “Shovelhands Katz” because of his large hands and his ability to catch the ball. Even so,
              from his days as a child through his college years, he had been kidded by being called “Pussy Katz.” After
              my older brother, Steven was born, my father decided to change the family name so his son would not be
              ridiculed. He changed it to “Kraig,” keeping the “K” of “Katz” and giving the family a new name. May both
              my father and brother rest in peace.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">So how is there bragging rights associated with that name? The
              name “Katz” is an abbreviation or acronym (in the Kabbalah it is called a <span
                class="italic">Notarikon</span>, of which more will be said later). It is short for “<span
                class="italic"><span class="bold">K</span></span>ohain <span class="italic"><span
                  class="bold">Tz</span></span>eh-deck” (with the vowel “a” added between the initial letters of the two
              words). In Hebrew, those two words mean “righteous priest.” This indicates that I <span
                class="italic">may</span> be a descendant of the ancient priestly caste. When in synagogue and called to
              the altar to say the blessings over the Torah, I am one of the tribe of the Kohanim. If this is accurate,
              then it would be my right to learn and share the Kabalah. But before you think this bit of knowledge has
              gone to my head, let me remind you that this “revelation” comes attached to these lessons as a sidebar to
              a section dealing with “mythological history.”</span></div>

    </div>
    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As a side note, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries,
        the first real, great archaeological discoveries in Egypt took place. People around the world (especially
        occultists, who at times are not the most level-headed of people) were fascinated by the secrets of ancient
        Khem. Thus, when they read in the Bible that Moses was educated in Egypt, they assumed that the Kabalah had an
        Egyptian origin. While it is true that there were mystery schools in Egypt&mdash;in fact, Pythagoras studied at
        one&mdash;there is no proof that the Kabalah is taken directly from the wisdom of Egypt. However, it is likely
        that the Kabalah was influenced by the spiritual systems of ancient India, Egypt, Babylon, etc.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">And so it was that the mystical secrets of the Kabalah were kept for
        hundreds of years by the Hebrew priesthood. But the common Hebrew man and woman did not learn the lessons of the
        Decalogue and the other laws which God had intended them to learn. Thus, God punished the people of Israel over
        and over until the destruction of the second Temple in the year 70 C.E. Rome had ordered the destruction, and
        had wanted rabble-rousers and freedom-loving troublemakers rounded up. One of these was a rabbi named Simeon ben
        (sometimes written “bar”) Yochai. He managed to evade the Romans by hiding with his son in a cave for thirteen
        years (there is a special meaning in the number thirteen, which will be revealed later in this course). In the
        cave, these two learned men wrote down the secrets of the Kabalah for the first time in a large set of books
        titled <span class="italic">Sepher Ha-Zohar</span> or just the <span class="italic">Zohar</span> (Book of
        Splendor) and the small <span class="italic">Sepher Yetzirah</span> (Book of Formation). Later, when publishing
        became practical thanks to Gutenberg, these books became available to people all over the world. Thus it was
        that although the <span class="italic">Diaspora</span>&mdash;the exile of the Jews throughout the world after
        the destruction of the second temple&mdash;was decried by most Jews, mystical Jews have held that this diaspora
        was God’s gift to all humankind, because in that way they were able to spread the divine wisdom of the Kabalah,
        rather than keep it hidden in a small section of the Middle East.</span></div>
    <h2 class="calibre29"><span class="calibre30">
        <span class="bold1">The History of the Kabalah-Factual</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Little is known as to where the Kabalah actually originated. There do
        seem to be elements of ancient Chaldean, Egyptian, Babylonian, and even pre-Hindu Indian (what I refer to as
        “proto-Tantric”) mysticism, as well as elements drawn from other, less well-known Semitic peoples hidden in its
        depths. More modern aspects of the Kabalah either were heavily influenced by Neoplatonic theories or, in fact,
        influenced the Neoplatonists.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The earliest known form of Hebrew mysticism (not counting earlier
        shamanistic forms that seem to exist in all primitive tribes and societies) was not even called Kabalah. The
        earliest form of Hebrew occultism was known as “Heh-cha-loht” (with the “ch” sounding like that in the Scottish
        word “loch”), which means “ascent.” It is also known as Merkabah mysticism. The Merkabah was the name of the
        Throne of God in Hebrew, and it was the aim of the Merkabah mystics to be able to see God upon His
        Throne.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Unfortunately, most of the writings of the “Merkabah Riders” have been
        lost, so that full knowledge of their techniques is impossible. Although more and more is being uncovered, much
        is still debatable. From what little we know, the concepts of this tradition seem to be based upon mystical
        contemplation of the early chapters of Genesis and the vision of Ezekiel. These methods are known respectively
        as Mah-ah-seh B’ray-sheet and Mah-ah-seh Mer-kah-bah. From the fragments of Merkabah mysticism that still
        remain, it is assumed that the actual practices of these mystics involved “astral travel” through a series of
        seven “places” (planes?) by way of certain passwords, talismans, and secret signs while in a state of
        self-induced trance (possibly via self-hypnosis, physical duress, psychoactive drugs, or extended periods of
        sex). The names of each of the guards at each of the seven palaces had to be known so that they could be
        appeased in some way. Unfortunately, the knowledge of those appeasement methods is also currently lost or
        unknown.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Although this has not been one of my interests, it is my hope that
        some intrepid individual or group does some spiritual and astral investigations and recovers the lost
        information. Perhaps it will be one of the people reading these lessons. To whet your appetite and to make this
        search easier, here, for the first time in any popular course or publication (to my knowledge) are the correct
        names of the guardians that are known (from the fragments of the book <span class="italic">Pirkei
          Heichaloht</span>):</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">First Palace</span>: Dehaviel, Kashriel,
        Gahoriel, Botiel, Tofhiel, Dehariel, Matkiel, and Shuiel (though some say Sheviel).</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Second Palace</span>: Tagriel, Matpiel, Sarhiel,
        Arfiel, Sheharariel, Satriel, Regaiel, and Saheviel.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Third Palace</span>: Shevooriel, Retzutziel,
        Shulmooiel, Savliel, Zehazahiel, Hadriel, and Bezariel. (<span class="italic">Note:</span> There are only seven
        guards listed in the fragments, not the usual eight, implying that one of the names has been lost.)</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Fourth Palace</span>: Pachdiel, Gevoortiel,
        Kazooiel, Shekhiniel, Shatkiel, Araviel, Kafiel, and Anaphiel.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Fifth Palace</span>: Tachiel, Uziel, Gatiel,
        Getahiel, Safriel, Garafiel, Gariel, Dariel, and Falatriel. (<span class="italic">Note:</span> There are nine
        guards listed here, which is one too many.)</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Sixth Palace</span>: Katzmiel, Gehaghiel,
        Roomiel, Arsavrasbiel, Agroomiel, Faratziel, Mechakiel, and Tofariel.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Seventh Palace</span>: For this palace there were
        two sets of names. They were described as one set for “ascending” and one for “descending,” the meaning of which
        is unclear. My guess is that different names were used to enter and exit this palace.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The focus of this book is on the Kabalah, not on becoming a Merkabah
        Rider. Since other techniques (how to go into trance, how to astral travel) are needed and further information
        (the appropriate passwords and needed talismans) is unknown, I am not going to give a listing of the names of
        the rest of the guardians as this might lead to some unwise experimentation. My purpose in listing the names of
        the guards above (which in the tradition needed to be memorized) merely has been to show you the complexity of
        the system. Those who wish to go further into the topic have the name of one of the few sources in a preceding
        paragraph. If you experiment with this, I wish you good luck and hope you will share your results with the rest
        of us.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The final goal of the Merkabah Rider was to be able to gaze upon the
        Throne of God and upon God Himself. This was no easy task, as you can see from the small amount of material I
        have given above. Also, remember that even Moses was not allowed to view the face of God, for it was said that
        no mortal could gaze upon the face of God and survive.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There are obvious similarities to Egyptian lore as presented in the
        so-called <span class="italic">Egyptian Book of the Dead</span> (more accurately, the <span class="italic">Book
          of Coming Forth by Day</span>), especially the idea of going through various places, e.g., hells of the
        Egyptian afterlife (the Egyptian hells should not be confused with the Christian idea of Hell), and passing
        tests in order to pass safely through these nether realms. Did the Hebrews copy from the Egyptians, or vice
        versa? Or did both come from an older source? Or perhaps both cultures (along with others such as Tibetan and
        Amerind) just happened to tap into the same mystical current. Nobody knows.</span></div>

        <span class="bold1">The</span>
        <span class="italic1"><span class="bold1">Sepher Yetzirah</span></span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Moving into the actual Kabalistic period of Hebrew mysticism, we come
        across the first well-known Kabalistic book, the <span class="italic">Sepher Yetzirah</span> or “Book of
        Formation.” This book seems to be a combination of the earlier Merkabah mysticism and the more modern Kabalah.
        The <span class="italic">Sepher Yetzirah</span>, along with another work, the <span class="italic">Bahir</span>,
        have been traced back to the earliest centuries of the Common Era. Within them are discussions of such things as
        emanations from Divinity bringing about the universe. This idea is known today as Neoplatonism. However, if we
        assume that the Kabalah was either brought to the Egyptians by the Hebrews, or that the Egyptians had the
        knowledge prior to the period of the enslavement of the Hebrews,<a id="calibre_link-120"
          href="#calibre_link-117"><sup class="calibre31">2</sup></a> then it might be that Neoplatonism was a
        development of the Kabalah. As stated before, it is well documented that Pythagoras, who is still famous for the
        Pythagorean Theorem (the sum of the squares of two sides of a right triangle is equal to the square of the
        hypotenuse), studied mysticism and was initiated into Egyptian mystery schools. It is not unlikely that he
        learned some early form of Kabalah there and brought it back to his home in the Greek city-states. It is not
        impossible that Plato and his later followers adopted the idea of emanations as a result of studying in
        Pythagoras’ mystery school, begun when Pythagoras returned to the Greek isles from the Middle East. Of course,
        this is speculation, but is based on probabilities.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">That Kabalistic mysticism continued to develop during the centuries of
        the Common Era since the beginning of the diaspora cannot be disputed. It is one of the reasons that Jews were
        hated and feared. Part of the Kabalah is related to magickal abilities, and many people fear magick. In the
        fourteenth century, Moses de Leon made the first printing of the <span class="italic">Zohar</span>, the classic
        Kabalistic text. Some modern scholars, and some contemporaries of de Leon, have called it a fraud. They say that
        it was not the original <span class="italic">Zohar</span> of legend written by Simeon ben Yochai, and that de
        Leon forged the entire work. Although I do not claim to be a great archaeological scholar, I find this
        contention hard to accept. Parts of the whole long work in various forms have been discovered in other works
        dating before the fourteenth century. However, it does seem likely that de Leon did edit and add some of his own
        mystical philosophy to the <span class="italic">Zohar</span>. Even so, let us assume for a moment that Moses de
        Leon did create the <span class="italic">Zohar</span> as it is printed today (one current English translation
        fills five volumes). If so, it is a monumental work of mystical thought. Besides, whether it is ancient or
        relatively recent, it should be studied for what is in it, not for who wrote it.</span></div>

              things that would make up a good spiritual teacher, but I’m not trying to give a thorough answer to that
              question here. However, there are three things I would require of a spiritual teacher:<div

              saying the teacher has to be good at any of these things. I like to think I’m decent as a teacher and will
              sing and dance&mdash;but I’m no Josh Groban or Michael Flatley. And my singing and dancing gives me plenty

          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">That brings up another question. Does God fulfill these

          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">When it comes to singing, I would say “Absolutely.” There is a

              dance. God tells them to stop because he wants no celebration over the deaths of so many Egyptians. The
              inference is that God would have enjoyed the singing and dancing at another time.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">When it comes to laughter, God actually plays a practical joke
              on Moses. Moses asks to see God, but God tells him that no man can see his face and live. God tells Moses
              that this is what he’ll do. “Stand upon a rock [. . .] and [I] will cover thee with my hand while I pass

    </div>
    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">To sum up, the Kabalah is not a single book or simple mystical idea.
        Rather, it is a whole system of mystical thought and action. It is the mystical underpinnings for Judaism,
        Christianity, and (to a lesser extent) Islam. As the Middle Ages developed in Europe, many locations became
        Kabalistic centers, the most important ones being in Spain. But in 1492, the year Columbus sailed, the Jews were
        expelled from Spain. It is for this reason that some people believe that Columbus (actually Cristobal Colon was
        his name in Spanish, and “Colon” may have been a variation of “Cohen”) may have been Jewish, and his trip, they
        believe, was to find a home for the expelled Jews. Be that as it may, many of the Jews returned to the Middle
        East, and a large, important Kabalistic center developed there in the city of Tzfat (usually transliterated as
        “Safed”), a town that still exists in modern Israel.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Two things happened that took the Kabalah away from being part of the
        mainstream of Judaism. One was a twelfth-century book by the respected Rabbi Moses Maimonides called A <span
          class="italic">Guide for the Perplexed</span>. In this book, supposedly “rational” (at least more rational
        than Kabalistic concepts in Western scientific terms) solutions to theoretical and philosophical problems in
        Judaism were given. Maimonides was trying to make Judaism compatible with the ideas of Aristotle.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">A virtual war of words developed between the followers of Maimonides’
        “rational” approach (there is still much mysticism and magick even in his “rationality”) and those who believed
        in the Kabalah. This “war” went on for years, the most famous proponent of the Kabalah being the Rabbi
        Nahmanides of the thirteenth century. Meanwhile, many schools of the Kabalah had developed, each with slightly
        different ideas of Kabalistic theory and practice, such as the schools of Isaac Luria (sixteenth century) and
        Isaac the Blind (late twelfth through early fourteenth centuries). The final blow to the Kabalah, along with the
        <span class="italic">Guide for the Perplexed</span>, came in the form of a man named Sabbatai Zvi
        (1626-1676).</span></div>
    <h3 class="calibre32"><span class="calibre33"><span class="italic1">
          <span class="italic1"><span class="bold1">A New Hope</span></span>
        </span></span></h3>
    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Zvi (or Zebi, or Zwi) had an intense, charismatic personality. He was
        also very learned in both traditional and mystical (Kabalistic) Jewish knowledge. He became more and more
        popular in the Middle East until he was proclaimed by his followers as the Messiah, the savior of the Jews. He
        never denied that he was the Messiah. Word of his magickal powers, wisdom, and Godliness spread via Jewish
        traders to Jewish communities throughout the Middle East, Asia, and Europe. In the Middle East, where he spent
        most of his life, he developed many diehard zealots as followers. Finally, the Islamic sultan could no longer
        ignore him. The resultant meeting between the two led to the discrediting of Zvi and his conversion to Islam,
        after which he was exiled to a prison in Albania, where he died as a false Messiah.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Deceived Jewry tried to forget and put out of their lives everything
        that reminded them of Zvi. In fact, many Jewish books wouldn’t even give his name, only calling him “that one.”
        Since Zvi was associated with the Kabalah and magick, this too was discarded and the position of Maimonides was
        accepted. Except for small groups of secretive believers, Judaism deserted the Kabalah.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">The Kabalah was saved from being perhaps totally lost by those
        Christians whose goal was to study the inner teachings of Judaism in order to prove that Jesus was, in fact, the
        Christ, the Jewish Messiah, and thus turn all Jews into Christians. As you can see, there are still Jews in the
        world today, and the attempt failed. But it did cause the translations of many documents and books that had
        never before been translated out of the Hebrew or Aramaic. The possibility of real magickal secrets that were
        holy and not satanic in nature caught the fancy of many scholars and clerics, up to and including Eliphas Levi
        (born Alphonse Louis Constant). Levi’s most famous work, translated poorly into English, is now in print under
        the title <span class="italic">Transcendental Magic</span>. His books and teachings helped start what has been
        called the “French Occult Revival” of the nineteenth century. At that time, many occult groups began to develop
        in France and spread to other countries, most notably Austria, Germany, and England. Some of these groups used
        their occultism to support questionable ethics, leading to “magickal wars” between occult groups in France, and
        the evil of Nazism in Germany.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Looking for a second back on the “lighter” side of occultism, we come
        in England to the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, whose primary importance came in their taking the teachings
        of the Kabalah as a basis for their occultism and uniting it with other forms of occultism such as the magickal
        systems (or supposed magickal systems based on their sometimes incomplete knowledge) of Egypt, of Enochian
        magick, of the magick of Abramelin, and of mysticism from India, as well as other sources. We will deal with all
        of these as need be in this course.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The Kabalah that we study in this course is a modern Kabalah. The
        Kabalah is a philosophical system of life as well as a magickal system and, as such, has changed over the
        centuries to meet the needs of the people of the contemporary society. Besides differences in interpretations of
        the Kabalah based on different sects’ attitudes, there are two major divisions in the Kabalah today.</span>
    </div>
    <h2 class="calibre29"><span class="calibre30">
        <span class="bold1">Two Divisions of the Kabalah</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">First, there is what I call the “Kosher Kabalah.” This has come about
        as a result of the need for a Jewish spiritual rebirth. Right now, in America at least, the number of Jews is
        rapidly decreasing. Oh, there may be more Jews numerically, but for many it is merely a group or cultural
        association and nothing more. Judaism is both a religion and a culture, and a person can be part of either or
        both. Thus, there can be religiously atheistic Jews who retain their cultural Judaism, and religious Jews who
        are alienated from archetypal Jewish culture.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I feel that part of the reason an increasing number of people who are
        culturally Jewish have abandoned the religious aspect of Judaism is at least in part due to the extreme lack of
        spirituality found in some of the major forms of Judaism. As I wrote in the introduction to the book, I
        initially experienced Judaism as very scientific combined with going to synagogue on the Sabbath and holidays
        and following the negative golden rule. Not too much spiritual there. This lack of spirituality may have
        resulted in a moving away from standard Judaism, and the fact that there is a disproportionately large
        percentage of Jews being attracted to various cults that disguise themselves as religions. But some Jews are
        looking toward their own spiritual roots and are rediscovering their Kabalistic heritage. The Kosher Kabalah,
        then, has a particularly Jewish tone to it. It benefits all students of the mystical as we are obtaining more
        and more ancient Kabalistic works, which are finally being translated into modern languages. But, because it is
        so oriented toward one point of view, it is not our main concern.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The “WASP Kabalah” follows&mdash;or rather, leads&mdash;what has been
        called the Western mystery tradition as exemplified in the concepts of the Golden Dawn. This system of Kabalah
        <span class="italic">universalizes</span> the Kabalistic wisdom so that it may be accepted by all, no matter
        your particular faith or lack thereof. This “syncretistic” system of the Kabalah is the one that we will be
        studying. Because the Kabalah has been safeguarded for thousands of years by the Jewish culture it is obvious
        that it will have, in many instances, a Jewish flavor. That is partially why we will be using many words that
        are in Hebrew. However, since we will be studying the WASP Kabalah and not the Kosher Kabalah&mdash;since we are
        studying a universalized Kabalah&mdash;you do not have to be or become a Jew or Christian or Pagan or follow any
        particular religion or belief in order to study the philosophy and magickal techniques of the Kabalah and
        traditional Western ceremonial magick.</span></div>
    <h2 class="calibre29"><span class="calibre30">
        <span class="bold1">Four Branches of the Kabalah</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">There are four main branches to the Kabalah. Although the title of the
        divisions are clear, some of the aspects of each branch overlap.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre24">
      <div class="calibre25">
        <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">1. <span class="italic">The Dogmatic Kabalah</span>. This
            concerns the study of the literatures of the Kabalah such as the <span class="italic">Torah</span>, the
            <span class="italic">Sepher Yetzirah</span>, the <span class="italic">Bahir</span>, the <span
              class="italic">Zohar</span>, and many others. Although their study is fascinating, it is not the focus of
            this course. The names of various books and appropriate sections from them or ideas from them will be given
            when they are needed, but the dogmatic Kabalah will not be a primary concern of these lessons.</span>

      </div>
      <div class="calibre25">
        <blockquote class="calibre21">
          <div class="calibre19">2. <span class="italic">The Practical Kabalah</span>. This refers to the making of
            talismans and amulets via Kabalistic methods. It is the basis for Kabalistic magick when mixed with the
            following two branches of Kabalistic study. The methods of the practical Kabalah are neither good nor bad,
            but can be used for what might be called “positive or negative” purposes. Therefore, it is necessary to
            first give you the work that will prepare you so that not only would you not have a desire to do magick for
            negative purposes, but so that you will understand the consequences that will result for yourself if you try
            to use magick for negative purposes. Thus, we will not be taking up the practical Kabalah for a few more
            lessons.<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Please don’t misinterpret the last paragraph to imply
                that if you follow the techniques as given in this course you will become a namby-pamby, fluffy-bunny
                magician who is all sweetness and light. No, by following the methods given here you can become a
                powerful magician, afraid of no other entity, physical or otherwise. But, rather than moving blindly
                with no understanding of the rules of the universe as explained by the Kabalah, by following these
                lessons and learning all the information, you can become a true wise man or woman, a wizard, a warrior
                of the light. You won’t want to do negative magick because you’ll have no need to do negative
                magick.</span></div>
            <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">When we do get into the practical Kabalah and into Grey
                Magick, we will truly soar. Nor will we be limited to the kabalistic methods of magick. As an example,
                just in dealing with talismans we will be discussing Pagan, numerological, Rosicrucian, and other
                systems for making these devices.</span></div>

        <blockquote class="calibre21">
          <div class="calibre19">3. <span class="italic">The Literal Kabalah</span>. This concerns the relationships
            between the numbers and letters of the Hebrew alphabet. The ancient Hebrews did not have separate figures to
            represent numbers, so they used the letters of their alphabet. It was believed that if two words had the
            same numerical total, they had a significant relationship to each other, and in some cases could be
            considered synonyms. As an example, <span class="italic">aheva</span> = 13 and <span
              class="italic">echod</span> = 13. Therefore, <span class="italic">aheva</span> is the same as <span
              class="italic">echod</span>. <span class="italic">Echod</span> is the Hebrew word meaning “one.” Since in
            Judaism there is only one God, it also represents God. <span class="italic">Aheva</span> is Hebrew for
            “love.” Therefore, according to this system, God is love. Further, the holiest name of God, the
            Tetragrammaton or YHVH, totals 26. Since 13 + 13 = 26, we can say that love (<span
              class="italic">aheva</span>) plus oneness (<span class="italic">echod</span>) equals the nature of God
            (YHVH). This process is known as <span class="italic">Gematria</span> (“geh-may-treeyah”). As we go on in
            the lessons, you will see the vital import that Gematria plays in ceremonial magick. It will be explained
            more fully in another lesson. (By the way, do you remember that I said I would explain the meaning of the
            number 13 earlier in this lesson?)<div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span
                  class="italic">Notarikon</span> (“Noh-tayr-ih-kon”) is another aspect of the literal Kabalah. It is a
                system of finding acronyms, where the first letters of a series of words gives a new word or words.
                English examples of this system would be Mothers Against Drunk Driving becoming MADD or North Atlantic
                Treaty Organization becoming NATO. (While I was in college I tried to form the Society to End Acronyms
                or SEA. Somehow it never caught on.) As you can see, they do not have to form familiar words, although
                they may do so. “Ah-tah Gee-boor Lih-oh-lahm Ah-doh-nye” is Hebrew for “Thou art great forever, my
                Lord.” It is represented by the Notarikon (or acronym) AGLA, pronounced “Ah-glah,” as given in the
                Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram. “Amen” in Hebrew is composed of three letters: aleph, mem,
                nun&mdash;AMN. They are a Notarikon for Al (pronounced “ehl” and meaning “God”) Melech (meaning “king”)
                Neh-eh-mahn (meaning “faithful”). Thus, Amen, the Notarikon for “Al Melech Neh-eh-mahn,” means “God is
                our faithful king.” The phrase is a repetitive refrain in a Hebrew call and response prayer, and is the
                inner meaning of the word “Amen.”</span></div>

                system of transposition of letters such as is used in cryptography and the making of codes. Its primary
                importance is in interpretation of the Torah (known as exegesis) and in making talismans. There are
                several different forms of Temurah, and theoretically, there’s no reason why you could not make up your
                own. Here are some of the more popular methods of this system:</span></div>

            <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Avgad</span>: A very simple kind of
                Temurah wherein any letter is replaced by the letter that follows it in the alphabet. Thus, in English,
                “a” is written as “b,” “b” is written as “c,” etc. The name of this method comes from the first four
                Hebrew letters, Alef (pronounced “a”), Bet (pronounced here as “v”), Gimmel (“g”), and Dallet (“d”),
                forming the word “avgad” and explaining that “a” becomes “b” and “g” becomes “d.”</span></div>

                are only used at the end of words) are mixed according to a certain pattern. They are placed in nine
                boxes of three letters each. Thus is formed a figure three boxes high and three boxes across. In Aik
                Bekar you can have any letter in a box represent either of the other two letters in that box. In the
                first box&mdash;which has the letters aleph, yud, and koph (the “Aik” of Aik Bekar)&mdash;the yud could
                represent either the koph or the aleph. So, too, could the koph represent the aleph or the yud, and the
                aleph could represent either the yud or the koph. Although simple in design, this results in potentially
                complex codes.</span></div>

        known as the Tree of Life. In the garden of Eden as described in the book of Genesis of the Jewish Bible, there
        were two important trees growing with the other flora and fauna. One was the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and
        Evil. According to the exoteric interpretation of this passage, it was by eating from this tree that Adam and
        Eve fell from grace. God then drives Adam and Eve from the garden because the Tree of Life is there, and, as God
        says, “Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and
        take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever.” Although not having good syntax, this biblical
        quotation indicates clearly that the Tree of Life is considered to be highly important, capable of bringing

    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Diagrams are frequently used to represent other things. A diagram of a
        miniature solar system can be used to represent the appearance of an atom. Its many valence levels filled with
        electrons are represented by the “orbiting planets,” and the nucleus is represented by the stationary Sun. This
        works for most chemical considerations, but modern subatomic nuclear physics tends to ignore the solar system
        model of the atom, replacing it with tiny waves of energy that constantly move toward and away from the center
        of the atom. For most practical purposes, however, the solar system model of the atom works and is still taught
        in schools. It is only a map of the reality that gives us a way to understand the reality, but the map is not
        the territory; it is only a model.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There are other models for other purposes. One such model, shown
        above, is a triangle with Yin and Yang at the lower angles and Tao at the top. Yin represents all things which
        are archetypically female: cold, wet, winter, receptivity, intuitiveness, etc. Yang represents all things which
        are archetypically male: warm, dry, summer, aggressiveness, logic, etc. Tao represents the balance of these two
        ideas. Balance, according to Taoism, is the desired state. For a person to be balanced, he or she must have
        aspects of both Yin and Yang.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Other things can be reflected in this Yin-Yang-Tao triangle. Father,
        Son, Holy Spirit (the Holy Spirit in Gnosticism was seen as being female); liberal, conservative, centrist
        politics; body, mind, and spirit; and many other trinities. A most important one for modern philosophy was first
        written by the German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770- 1831) and is known as the Hegelian
        Dialectic, or the “Thesis-Antithesis-Synthesis Theory.” This theory holds that if you have one condition or
        situation (thesis) but wish to change it to another, usually opposite condition or situation (antithesis), the
        result will not be either the new or old, but rather a mixture (synthesis) of the opposing positions. This is
        why revolutions rarely achieve their goals. Instead, they end as a mixture of what was and what was desired. The
        method of nature is evolution, not revolution.</span></div>

        the highest one points up, then two triangles point down, and finally a single circle hangs pendant to the
        triangles at the bottom. Note that there are twenty-two paths numbered from 11 through 32 connecting the
        circles.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">These circles are known as the <span class="italic">Sephiroht</span>

        have a dual nature. If Divinity is male, then Divinity is not female and thus is limited. Divinity is the

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As soon as we put any qualities upon Divinity we limit the
        Source-of-All. As stated, a male God limits God to being not-female. A merciful Divinity does not have the
        righteous severity of being just. A Divinity that is limited cannot be the ultimate Divinity. It follows,
        therefore, that the only quality we can put upon Divinity is that Divinity is <span class="italic">without
          limit</span>. And the Hebrew expression for “without limit” is <span class="italic"><span class="bold">Ain
            Soph</span>.</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">As stated earlier, it was believed that anyone who beheld the face of God could not live.
        On this planet we can barely stand to look at the Sun on a bright day for more than a fraction of a second. It
        is too bright. Since we cannot behold a bright light, nor can we behold the “face of God,” it follows that there
        is a relationship between the two, and that the first conceivable yet unknowable and unexperienceable aspect of
        Divinity is brightness beyond comprehension, brightness beyond any brightness of which we can conceive: <span
          class="italic">Limitless Light</span>. The Hebrew for “light without limit” is <span class="italic"><span
            class="bold">Ain Soph Or</span></span>. These three conceptions are conceived to be above the Tree of Life
        with a “veil” beneath each, as shown in the following diagram:<div class="calibre2"><img alt="028"

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Because the word “Ain” means “nothing,” these three conceptions above
        the first Sephirah have been called <span class="italic">the Three Veils of Negative Existence</span>. However,
        they have been called so wrongly, because in context Ain does not mean “nothing,” but rather “no-thing” that our
        mortal minds can conceive, understand, or know.</span></div>
    <h2 class="calibre29"><span class="calibre30">
        <span class="bold1">The Formation of the Universe</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">The earliest known Kabalistic theory as to how the universe was formed
        comes from the <span class="italic">Sepher Yetzirah</span> . It holds that God moved the magickal Hebrew letters
        in such a way that the physical universe was formed. This is a basis of Grey Magick, which we will get into
        later in the course. Today, the most popular Kabalistic theory of the creation of the universe is the system
        described by the famous Rabbi Isaac Luria (1534-1572). According to Luria, before the creation Divinity filled
        the universe. Then, for some unknown reason, God decided to create. God allowed a tiny part of “Himself” to
        shrink out of the universe, leaving a space. However, in some mysterious way God still filled this space much as
        a fragrant rose when removed from a room will still leave its essence or scent behind. This process Luria called
        “tzim-tzum.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">God then sent a beam of energy from within “Himself ” out into the
        newly abandoned space, apparently trying to create containers for this energy. But, for some reason unknown to
        us, God appears to have failed, with the result that the containers were shattered, forming the shells or what
        is known as the <span class="italic">Kellipoht</span>, the places where “demons” dwell. God attempted the
        process again, this time succeeding. The energy from the <span class="italic">Ain</span> went through the <span
          class="italic">Ain Soph</span>, through the <span class="italic">Ain Soph Or</span> and into the first
        Sephira. That Sephira filled with energy, then overflowed into Sephira number two. Sephira two filled and
        overflowed into Sephira three, and so forth down the Tree of Life into Sephira ten where an equilibrium, a
        balance, was established.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As the energy proceeds down the Tree, it goes from being very ethereal
        and spiritual in nature until in the tenth Sephira it manifests as the physical plane and our planet, Earth.
        Thus, this energy is seen as constantly creating our universe. This energy comes directly from Divinity, and
        without it all would instantly cease to be. With this simple way of looking at the Tree of Life we can see how
        truly God must love us to constantly be giving us existence.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Here is a type of mathematical way of looking at existence as
        represented by the Tree of Life: From no-thing comes Limitlessness (outer space). Filling this Limitlessness is
        Limitless Light (the big bang, or perhaps the space-time continuum). But this is all abstract. This is just
        energy. Now we need to develop solidity out of energy.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">We start with the idea of position, what in plane geometry is called
        the point (first Sephira). By reflecting itself, the first point can create a second point (second Sephira). By
        joining the two points together we form a line. But there is nothing by which to judge length. So again, by
        reflection, we create a third point (third Sephira), which enables us to say that point A is closer to point B
        than B is to point C. Thus we have formed a triangle or plane. But this has all been what is called Euclidian:
        it exists on an imaginary two-dimensional surface with no thickness. To create a physical universe, we need
        substance, we need three dimensions. We need knowledge (Dah-at, the theoretical Sephira said to exist between
        the upper three and lower seven Sephiroht) in order to cross the void from two dimensions to three.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The Tree of Life exists everywhere, not just as circles on a piece of
        paper or as a philosophical construct. It also exists within the human being on a variety of levels. Picture
        yourself turning around and backing into the Tree of Life. This will give you a good idea of how the Tree exists
        on the body. The uppermost Sephira is just above the top of the head. The second Sephira is at the left side of
        the face, although it is on the right side of the Tree. The third Sephira is on the left side of the Tree and on
        the right side of the face. This continues down the entire body. We will be studying more of these relationships
        with the Tree of Life, part of the unwritten Kabalah, in the next lesson.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">But for now we must turn our focus away from the Kabalah and toward
        India. Here, some of the most ancient of spiritual texts, the <span class="italic">Tantras</span>, speak of
        psychic centers known as <span class="italic">chakras</span>. (<span class="italic">Note:</span> The “ch” is
        pronounced very hard, as in the word “chalk,” and <span class="italic">never</span> soft as if it were an “sh.”
        That would require the word to start with a different Sanskrit letter, and people who pronounce it “shakras” may
        have never been trained in Sanskrit pronunciation. It may also be pronounced as “kahk-rahs.”) The chakras exist
        in the energy fields around our bodies. There is also an energy stream known as <span
          class="italic">kundalini</span> (pronounced “koon-duh-lee-nee”) which goes through these psychic centers. The
        oldest Tantras speak of only three major chakras: at the genitals, the heart, and at the top of the head. Later
        Tantras speak of four majorchakras: at the navel, the heart, the throat, and the top of the head. Even later
        books speak of six or seven major chakras, often disagreeing as to where the chakras are located. But most
        importantly, the books tell you that it is dangerous to attempt to raise the kundalini energy through the
        centers. To discover why this is so we must jump from ancient India to the late 1800s and Victorian
        Europe.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre13">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This was the era of Sigmund Freud (1856-1939). Although Freud outlived
        the Victorian era, much of his philosophy was heavily dependent upon his being raised in the Victorian period.
        It is also clear that Freud, a Jew, studied the Kabalah, in at least some cursory way. In his early writings on
        psychology Freud indicated that he believed that there was an actual, physical energy, a psycho-sexual energy,
        which he called “libido.” Freud believed that this energy came from all parts of the body and would move to a
        single part of the body. He called this process “cathexis.” He believed that all psychological problems could be
        traced to blockages of this psycho-sexual libido energy, and that was a problem.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Freud realized that if he was correct, the way to solve virtually all
        psychological problems would be to unblock this sexual energy. This meant, of course, that he would have to
        encourage people to have sexual relations. Freud knew that in an age still rife with repressive Victorian
        morality, this would never be accepted. This was especially true since many of the people Freud worked with were
        unmarried.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Freud was a pragmatist. He knew he would have to change his theories
        so that he could still help people. I don’t know if Freud was thinking in this direction, but it does seem to
        make sense that if getting energy moving would clear blockages, clearing blockages would also allow the energy
        to move freely. No matter how he came to this conclusion, Freud did change his notion of libido from an actual
        energy to a mere <span class="italic">desire</span>, which was capable of being focused in other directions. He
        called this process of focusing the energy in other directions “sublimation.” Unfortunately, since there was no
        longer an actual energy that was stopped, Freud now needed to come up with a desire that was contrary to libido.
        This he called the “death wish.” If it sounds confusing, it is. This is because Freud would not accept the
        reality of libido as an actual energy.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Meanwhile, one of Freud’s most creative students, Wilhelm Reich
        (1897-1957), decided that Freud had been correct in the first place. He set out to discover and actually measure
        Freud’s concept of psycho-sexual energy. Freud was quoted as saying that Reich was either a fraud or the future
        of the psychoanalytic movement. Later, Freud wrote the book <span class="italic">Civilization and Its
          Discontents</span> to denounce Reich’s theories.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Reich’s researches went far beyond the original theories of Freud.
        Reich called the psycho-sexual energy “orgone” and believed that he had seen it and measured it. Its color was a
        bright blue (such as in the LBRP). Reich invented group therapy, rebirthing, primal scream, bioenergetics, and
        certain educational systems; he also did sexological studies similar to Masters and Johnson decades before they
        began their research. Reich wrote several books on his theories and made devices (orgone accumulators) which he
        claimed could take orgone energy out of the environment to be used for healing purposes. For his efforts to
        enlighten the world, Reich was thrown in jail and his books were burned. (Here, in America, in the
        1950s!)</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">My point in this is not to get you to read a particular book or
        author, nor is it to criticize the actions of our government in the middle of the Mc-Carthy era. Rather, it is
        to show that Western science has studied and is well aware of the nature of the psycho-sexual energy. And this
        energy, originally called libido and later orgone in the West, is known as kundalini in India.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In India, however, the study of kundalini has gone on for thousands of
        years. As a result, they have a much deeper knowledge of it than does Western science. In a base and chaotic
        form it is said to lie “sleeping” in the area of the coccyx, the tip of the tailbone. On the surface of the body
        this appears at the perineum, the space between the sexual organs and the anus. Through imagination, special
        breathing and visualization methods, special sounds, or through sexual activity, this energy can be roused and
        sent up the spine, charging the psychic centers, the chakras, as it rises.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">Here is where the danger supposedly lies. The energy does not rise smoothly. It stops and
        charges each chakra. If you are not ready to have a particular chakra charged with energy, if you have not
        reached the appropriate stage of psychic development, one of two things can happen:<div class="calibre24">
          <div class="calibre25">
            <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">1. The chakra will be charged and the sudden influx of
                energy will “blow you away,” killing you, driving you insane, or, perhaps, enlightening you.</span>

            <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">2. The raised energy will have no place to go. Then you
                are like a filled balloon that is in a state of tension, which cannot pop nor have the air in it
                released. Something eventually has to give. Remember, Freud said (originally) that blockages were the
                cause of all psychological problems. If the kundalini becomes “stuck” at a lower chakra, it could result
                in a sexual obsession. Trying to raise the kundalini without proper instruction could also create severe
                physical problems. This is why in order to practice what is called kundalini yoga (which is a new name;
                its actual name is Laya Yoga), you should first get yourself a good teacher, known as a “guru.”<a

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The ancient Kabalists were also aware of this energy. It is sometimes
        known in Hebrew as <span class="italic">Ruach</span> (pronounced “roo-ach,” with the “ch” sounding like the
        German “ach”). It, too, cycles in the psychic centers. In the Kabalah there are five important psychic centers,
        each relating to a Sephira, and each also relating to a part of the psyche and the body of a human.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The <span class="italic">Yeh-chee-dah</span> (the “ch” as in the
        Scottish word “loch”) is the psychic center just above the head. It is the deepest level of the subconscious. It
        is always in contact with the Divine and it is sometimes known as our Higher Self. It relates to that aspect of
        God represented by the God name <span class="italic">Eh-heh-yeh</span>.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Ruach</span>, besides being the name of the
        energy we have been discussing, is also the name of the psychic center at the solar plexus. This is in the
        center of the torso above the stomach and just below the heart and breast. When this center is fully expanded it
        includes the heart. It represents our consciousness. Here we discover one of the basic differences between
        Eastern and Western mystical philosophy. In the East it is believed that our world is composed of nothing but
        vibrations. Our physical world is an illusion. This illusionary world called “Maya” is what is perceived by our
        consciousness by means of our senses. Therefore, our consciousness, by only seeing Maya, “slays” the true, inner
        reality. We are then told to “slay the slayer,” eliminate our consciousness via meditation and other techniques.
        Western occultism, perhaps being more pragmatic than its Eastern counterpart, says, “Let’s not slay the slayer,
        but rather let us <span class="italic">perfect</span> the slayer so that it no longer only sees illusions.” This
        is the process of developing the Will, which, by your ritual practice, you are now doing. The center relates to
        the God name <span class="italic">Yud-Heh-Vahv-Heh El-oh-ah V’dah-aht</span>.</span></div>

                  Regardie, who insisted I call him “Francis,” was virtually alone in keeping the traditions of the
                  Golden Dawn and Aleister Crowley alive between WWII and the 1960s, when his works were republished by
                  Llewellyn and made available to a new generation.</span></div>
              <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">At the time I met him, Francis lived in Studio City,

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The center known as <span class="italic">Nephesch</span> is located at
        the sexual organs. It represents the most superficial layer of our subconscious. It holds our lusts and urges
        and is capable of blocking the flow of energy between the Yeh-chee-dah and the Ruach. The God name here is <span
          class="italic">Sha-dai El Chai</span>.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">We can compare these Kabalistic ideas with other types of psychology:<div class="calibre2">
          <img alt="030" src="images/000017.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>
        <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In the Kabalistic system, there are two other psychic centers that
        need to be described.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The psychic center located at the feet is known as the <span
          class="italic">G’uph</span>. It represents the physical body. When standing, it actually goes above the feet
        and below the feet, into the earth or surface below your feet. Its God name is <span class="italic">Ah-doh-nye
          Ha-ah-retz</span>.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The center at the base of the throat has no name in Hebrew, but is
        known as “the link.” When activated, this center becomes the self-induced and self-devised link between the
        higher self (Yeh-chee-dah) and the conscious (Ruach). “The Link” is a good name, as it is a link between the
        centers above and below it. Its God name, borrowed from another Sephira, is <span
          class="italic">Yud-Heh-Vahv-Heh El-oh-heem</span>.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The energy we are going to work with is psycho-sexual in nature, and
        can be fully controlled by the mind (more on this in a later lesson). Problems can develop when you try to raise
        the energy from the sexual center because of the emphasis on the physical, earthy, and sexual nature of the
        energy. In our system we stress the psychological and spiritual nature of the energy; thus we can work in
        complete safety and without a guru. In this system we take the energy from our connection with the Divine, at
        the Yeh-chee-dah, and bring it down the “Middle Pillar” of our body. By the time the energy reaches the powerful
        sexual center it will have become so purified that, in effect, it spiritualizes the energies that otherwise
        might only be expressed in a sexual manner. This does not mean that you will lose any desire for sex, only that
        when you do have sexual relations you will have a greater, even spiritual experience, and not simply a physical
        experience. This ritual will make you neither more nor less interested in sex.</span></div>
    <h2 class="calibre29"><span class="calibre30">
        <span class="bold1">The Ritual of the Middle Pillar</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP ONE</span>. Do the Relaxation Ritual.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP TWO</span>. Do the LBRP. When finished,
        stand behind your altar (if you have one) with your hands at your sides, eyes closed, steady relaxed breathing,
        and, above all, try to get your mind into a still, quiet, and calm state.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP THREE</span>. Focus your attention just
        above the top of your head. As a result of the LBRP there should be a sphere of white brilliance at this point.
        If not, visualize it. Take your time. Regard this white brilliance with a sort of awe: it is the spatial
        equivalent to the vital core of your being, your Higher Self, your link with the Divine. The result of this
        contemplation should be that the brilliance becomes even brighter. Now vibrate the God name <span
          class="bold">Eh-heh-yeh</span> three or four times. The sphere should get brighter still.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP FOUR</span>. Now visualize a slender beam of
        light descending from the brilliance above your head through the center of your head, and stopping at the nape
        of your neck. Here the beam widens into a ball of light, although not as big as the one above. At this point you
        should be visualizing simultaneously the brilliant sphere above your head, the small ball of light at the base
        of your neck, and the beam of light connecting the two. Understand that this is the link between your conscious
        and your Higher Self, and the ball of light at your neck should grow in size and intensity. Vibrate the God name
        <span class="bold">Yud-Heh-Vahv-Heh El-oh-heem</span> three or four times.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP FIVE</span>. Keeping the above in mind,
        cause a beam of light to descend from the ball of light at your neck, go down your torso, and light up the solar
        plexus in the form of a sphere. Understand that this represents your consciousness, and the ball should increase
        in brightness and intensity. You may feel as if you are being warmed by an internal sun. Vibrate the God name
        <span class="bold">Yud-Heh-Vahv-He El-oh-ah V’dah-aht</span> three or four times.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP SIX</span>. In the same manner, see the
        light descend to the area of the genitals and form a sphere. Here, regard yourself as master of your “lower”
        self. The God name to be vibrated three or four times is <span class="bold">Shah-dai El Chai</span>.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP SEVEN</span>. Again the light should
        descend, here to form a sphere which encompasses both feet and the ground; that is, the sphere should be half
        above the ground, covering the feet, and half below the ground, under the feet. The God name to be vibrated
        three or four times is <span class="bold">Ah-doh-nye Ha-ahr-etz</span>.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP EIGHT</span>. At this point there should be
        large spheres of light above the head, at the throat, at the solar plexus, at the groin, and at the feet. Each
        sphere of light should be connected with the sphere above and below by a beam of light.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP NINE</span>. Stay in this state for as long
        as you desire. Then, take a deep breath and, as you exhale, visualize the images fading and becoming invisible.
        They are still there, but they cannot now be seen. This completes the Middle Pillar Ritual.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Remember the instructions on vibrating words. Each vibrated word
        should be done so that you can feel the appropriate area of the body vibrating. If at any point you have trouble
        or difficulty in forming a sphere of light or a beam of light, do NOT struggle for minutes on end until you
        break out in a sweat. Rather, stop where you are and complete Step Nine with the progress you have made. Several
        things could have caused the problem. They are usually mental in nature, either from conscious or unconscious
        sources. By repeating this ritual daily you will eventually be able to overcome any problem in a very natural,
        gentle manner. You will be a better, stronger, happier person for it.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP TEN</span>. Do the Tarot Contemplation
        Ritual. If you have been doing the ritual regularly for at least six weeks, you should begin using the all
        twenty-two cards of the Major Arcana.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP ELEVEN</span>. Record results, feelings,
        experiences, etc., in your ritual diary.</span></div>
    <h2 class="calibre29"><span class="calibre30">
        <span class="bold1">Beware of the Little Nasties!</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">It is after about two or three months of regular work that some
        students start to report some unusual phenomena. They may think that they are seeing, hearing, or even feeling
        strange things! This is <span class="italic">perfectly normal</span>, and I’d like to explain exactly what’s
        going on.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Without even knowing it, you have been working with what I call the
        “Astral Senses.” The Astral Senses include the ability to see, hear, feel, taste, smell, etc. on the higher
        planes (the planes will be discussed in a few lessons). Anything that you experience now has always been
        there&mdash;only now, for the first time, you have opened your senses enough so that you can become aware of
        it.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I first became aware of these things while watching a boring program
        on T.V. Suddenly, out of nowhere, a large serpent seemed to come out of the floor and descend back into the
        floor about a foot away from its point of entry! A friend of mine calls these things “astral garbage.” I call
        them “Little Nasties.” <span class="italic">They cannot harm you in any way!</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Let me repeat that&mdash;the Little Nasties cannot hurt you. They can
        be bothersome, however. Sometimes I’ll think that somebody is looking over my shoulder and I’ll spin around to
        see who it is only to find empty air! One time, while talking to a person at a party&mdash;okay, it was a cute
        woman I was trying to impress&mdash;I thought I saw an old friend walk by. I turned away suddenly from the woman
        I was talking with in order to say hello to . . . a potted plant! When I turned back to the woman I was talking
        with she gave me a strange look and quickly made an excuse to leave. Oh well, I did say that they could be
        bothersome. I don’t call them “Little Nasties” for nothing.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Other people have told me of seeing friends who weren’t there, as I
        did, and others have heard voices calling them. Some people see bright, sparkly spots floating through the air.
        Perhaps even without training you have heard someone call your name, only no one did so. At that time, for a
        moment, your astral hearing was open enough to hear one of those Little Nasties.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Not everyone experiences these critters. You may never see, hear, or
        experience them in any way. While opening the astral senses is important, you may never be contacted by the
        Little Nasties and still become a very successful magician. If you have seen them, or do see them in the future,
        don’t worry. It’s not a psychic attack, and you are not going crazy. And they can’t hurt you.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In fact, if you have the right attitude about Little Nasties, they can
        be sort of fun, especially at a boring party. In any event, don’t be surprised if these guys bring a little
        silliness, fun, and, at times, exasperation into your life.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In all honesty, I am not really sure what they are. In some cases they
        seem to be what are called “elementals” (more on them in another lesson). In other cases, because you are
        working via visualization on the astral plane, you may, like a weird cosmic magnet, just be attracting
        meaningless astral junk. Little Nasties are not evil entities. Many children have “invisible playmates,” and I
        believe that in many instances these are Little Nasties.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Prefatory Comments:</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre12"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">Reflection</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">We all read lots of things, from novels and magazines to
        advertisements, text messages, and “graphic novels” (what used to be called comic books). Most of these things
        are similar in that they’re meant to impart information, and, in most cases, we forget the specifics about them.
        They’re transient or short term at best. If you’ve been out of school for a few years, do you really remember
        everything from your textbooks? If you work for others, do you really remember everything from what was in that
        report you read last year?</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Modern Magick</span> was specifically designed to
        be different. That’s why each section is called a “lesson” instead of a “chapter.” Although you may choose to
        read it like other reading material, it’s my hope that you will treat it as something special, a guide that can,
        quite literally, change the way you approach the rest of your life.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If you’re willing to try it this way, I urge you to do two things
        before beginning a new lesson. First, reflect on what you’ve learned so far. Think about it: already you’ve
        learned a great deal about me, about keeping a dream diary, how to interpret dreams, how to keep a ritual diary,
        the history of the Tarot and how to choose a Tarot deck for use with this course, the Tarot Contemplation
        Ritual, the Relaxation Ritual, definitions of magick, divinatory meanings of the Major Arcana and how to do a
        Tarot reading, how to prepare for a ritual, the “weapons” or tools of a magician, how to draw an Earth Banishing
        Pentagram, how to take a Ritual Cleansing Bath, how to perform all the steps of the Lesser Banishing Ritual of
        the Pentagram, how to deal with psychic attack, how to perform the Four Solar Adorations, the mythological
        history of the Kabalah, a more factual history of the Kabalah, the four branches of Kabalah, the relation of
        Freud and Reich to magick, the Kabalistic power centers, the Middle Pillar Ritual, the effect of “Little
        Nasties,” and much, much more. <span class="italic">You have done an incredible amount of learning and work and
          deserve recognition for this!</span> So reflect on all you’ve learned and practiced over the last eight weeks.
        You might even want to write down how your life has improved from this amount of work.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Once you’ve reflected on what you’ve learned and done, there is
        something else to do. This is very important for your future development and success: <span class="italic">Feel
          great about your accomplishments!</span> Over a mere eight weeks you have learned and practiced more real
        traditional Western ceremonial magick than 99 percent of the people in the world will ever do. You should feel
        good about what you’ve done. And you’ve done all this without parents or governments or employers forcing you to
        do this. You’re what’s called “self-actualized.” You’re amazing and should be proud.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I know, in the West we’re trained not to feel pride. But I remember a
        statement from Aleister Crowley, who wrote, “An ounce of honest pride is better than a ton of false humility.”
        Be proud of your true accomplishments. However, that doesn’t mean you should become egotistical. I still
        remember my martial arts instructor, Sifu Douglas Wong, saying, “No matter how good you are, there is always
        someone better.” So while you should be proud of your accomplishments, you can still be modest. Crowley
        continued his quotation by adding “an ounce of true humility is worth an ounce of honest pride.” Eventually,
        when magick becomes a part of every moment of your life, you won’t need feelings of pride to support you.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">So revel in the feeling of your accomplishment, but don’t stay there.
        Instead, use your reflections and feelings of pride in accomplishment as spurs to urge you to continue and to
        learn and practice more. Then forget about the pride and humility and move on. The third part of Crowley’s
        quotation is “the man who works has no time to bother with either [pride or humility].”</span></div>

          <span class="bold1">PART ONE</span>
        </span></span></h1>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Have you ever heard of a “Sunday Morning Christian”? A Sunday Morning
        Christian is a person who goes to church every Sunday (to be seen), sings very loudly (to be heard), and puts
        large bills in the collection plate. Then, in business, he does everything possible to steal and cheat. He lies
        about his friends and enemies and he cheats on his wife. Yes, he puts on a big show of being a Christian for a
        few hours every Sunday, but when it comes to living every minute of the day after the manner of Jesus, what the
        Catholic Monk Thomas à Kempis (c.1380-1471) called “the Imitation of Christ,” he fails miserably.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">So what does this have to do with ceremonial magick? Like the Sunday
        Morning Christians who think that Christianity is something you do once a week, most people think that magick is
        something you do occasionally. This is totally wrong.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre20">
      <blockquote class="calibre21">
        <div class="calibre19">
          <div class="calibre12"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">Magick is</span>

        </div>
      </blockquote>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I cannot stress this enough. To really be a magician means that your
        mindset is totally centered on magick. This means that no matter what you are doing, thinking, or saying, there
        is always in your mind the idea of how everything is related magickally. Thus, if you are talking politics, you
        might be thinking about how a politician is able to convince people to vote for him or her without ever
        mentioning a political platform. Certainly convincing people to do things for no apparent reason is a powerful
        form of magick. When you are cooking you might think about how the element of fire affects meats and their
        byproducts, as well as the changes fire makes to fruits, grains, and vegetables. When magick becomes your way of
        thinking, acting, and breathing, then, and only then, will you be a true magician.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This brings us back, for a moment, to the Hermetic Order of the Golden
        Dawn. There were really six degrees in the Golden Dawn, which, if you did well, would allow you to seek entrance
        into the inner order, commonly known as the R.R. <span class="italic">et</span> A.C. If you have studied a bit
        about the Golden Dawn, this may shock you: <span class="italic">The Golden Dawn was never a magickal
          order</span>. The inner order, with initials standing for the Latin phrase <span class="italic">Roseae Rubeae
          et Aureae Crucis</span> (Red Rose and Gold Cross) was where members did practice practical magick. The outer
        order, the Golden Dawn, did not.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The Golden Dawn did have several purposes in the order’s overall
        scheme. It allowed people to meet and learn to have confidence in each other. It allowed people to learn the
        theories and philosophies that would later allow them to do practical magick. But for the purpose of this
        course, the most important aspects are that it initiated people and got them attuned to the four magickal
        elements.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Obviously, I cannot initiate you via a book. No one can (and I would
        highly question the notion of “astral initiation” offered by some organizations for Western traditions). But
        what is the need and purpose of initiation, anyway?</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Initiation has two aspects: practical and mystical. On a practical
        level, initiation gives you nothing. Rather, it allows you to <span class="italic">begin</span> to follow a
        certain prescribed system of mystical and/or magickal work. As an example, a person initiated into the Neophyte
        degree of the Golden Dawn was to begin learning the Hebrew alphabet, the symbols of the planets and the zodiac,
        and he or she was also to begin doing the LBRP. The word “initiation” comes from a Latin root that means “to
        begin.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The mystical aspects of initiation are a different story. Imagine a
        private club that you want to enter. You knock on the door and the bouncer, who doesn’t recognize you because
        you’re not on the list of people allowed in, sends you away. Then, a person who knows both you and the bouncer
        comes up and introduces you to each other. From that time on you are a welcome guest in the private club. In
        this little story, the introduction to a higher, stronger force in the form of a bouncer, was your initiation.
        In reality, the mystical aspects of initiation not only introduce you to higher powers (or, if you prefer, your
        Higher Self), but also cause spiritual, emotional, and <span class="italic">physical</span> effects within you,
        which allow you to be easily recognized in the future by the higher powers.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There is another way to cause the inner changes that allow this
        recognition. You could go up to the bouncer day after day, week after week, and month after month if need be,
        talk to the bouncer and bring him presents and friendship until finally, without a third-party introduction, the
        bouncer allows you into the club. The way that this can be done is through faithfully performing the three keys
        to succeeding with the work of this course: practice, practice, practice.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In the Golden Dawn, an initiation into the Neophyte grade gave you
        membership, companionship with others of a like mind, and allowed both you and the other members of the order to
        see how well you could work together. Since by working your way through the lessons in this book you are not
        becoming a member of any order, that particular initiation is not vital to your advancement. The next four
        grades of the Golden Dawn attempted to get you in balance with the four magickal elements and, in fact, were
        sometimes referred to as the “elementary” or “elemental” grades. We will be learning about the magickal elements
        Earth, Air, Fire, and Water, one at a time and in their proper order.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The Neophyte grade of the Golden Dawn was not related to the elements.
        In fact, it was not considered to be the first degree of the order at all. It was called the 0=0 Grade. The next
        degree, known as the first degree or 1=10 (first degree equals the tenth Sephira) was associated with the
        element of Earth, so it is there we must now begin. We must become in total harmony with this element.</span>
    </div>
    <h2 class="calibre29"><span class="calibre30">
        <span class="bold1">The Earth Element</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Each of the four magickal elements are representative of alternate
        aspects of the qualities of temperature and moisture or humidity. Since in this lesson we are working with the
        element of Earth, let’s examine its qualities. Obviously, Earth is not wet. Nor is it warm (except when infused
        with the element of Fire as seen in lava). Therefore, we can say that <span class="italic">the element Earth has
          the qualities of being dry and cool</span>.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The next step is to learn how to become aware of and in control of
        this element in our day-to-day life.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Exercise 1.</span> Make a list of things that
        have the combined qualities of dryness and coolness. However, don’t do this just out of your head. Rather, make
        a list of Earth things that you see each day. Practice this for one week. Be sure to record the results each day
        in your magickal diary.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Exercise 2</span>. Find a place filled with
        nature, such as a field or park. Wear as little clothing as you legally can (if possible, nudity is best, but do
        not break any laws), and sit or lie on the ground so that as much of your skin as possible is touching the
        ground. This is especially easy for someone wearing a flowing skirt (or kilt) with no underwear and then sitting
        on the ground with the fabric spread out. In this way there is nothing between the skin and the Earth. Spend
        some time contemplating, feeling the coolness and dryness of the Earth. You should do this at least three times
        within a week.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If you happen to find a grassy spot, or an area which has recently
        been watered, you may have a feeling that the magickal element of Earth has wetness in it. There are two
        responses to this. First, temperature and humidity are relative. It may be damp compared to desert sand, but it
        is dry compared to ocean water. Congratulations! This shows that you are thinking about the elements. However,
        the real answer to the idea that Earth has some wetness to it is that you are mistaking the physical soil for
        the magickal <span class="italic">archetypal</span> element Earth. A physical representation always lacks the
        purity of the archetype. Since we are physical and learn through our senses, we move in our minds from the
        physical imperfect object to the pure archetype. It is in this way we gain knowledge of the magickal
        elements.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Exercise 3.</span> Spend a period of up to three
        minutes (no more), once a day, <span class="italic">imagining that you are the element Earth</span>. Feel the
        heaviness, the slowness, the coolness, and the dryness of pure elemental Earth. Feel the way you could absorb
        the pains and problems of the world (however, do <span class="italic">not</span> actually do so). Become Earth.
        Do this exercise daily for at least a week before moving to the next exercise.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Exercise 4.</span> Once you have learned to “be
        Earth,” the next step is to control elemental Earth. Take a moment and imagine yourself to be Earth. Bring the
        feeling from the previous exercise into your consciousness. Next, hold your hands nine to twelve inches apart,
        palms facing each other. Imagine a bottle or box between your hands. Now, as you exhale, visualize all of the
        Earth element that is in you going out with your breath and into the container between your hands. Three to five
        breaths should be enough to fill it. Then, with three breaths, inhale it back into you and go back to normal
        consciousness.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">The Test</span>. This will allow you to see
        whether or not you really have become in harmony with the magickal element Earth and also to see if you are able
        to control the element.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The next time that you feel lightheaded, giddy, unstable, not able to
        do your work, etc., form the container of Earth as described in Exercise 4. Then, once the container of Earth
        has been formed, with one big inhalation, draw the contents of the container back into you. Within five minutes
        you should feel stable and grounded.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The next time that you feel bloated, overweight, slowed down, etc.,
        again form the container of Earth; only this time, visualize a large hole in the ground and drop the container
        into that hole. In your mind’s eye, quickly see the hole close around the container. You should feel lighter in
        a few minutes, but it may be necessary to repeat this exercise up to five times to really feel light (but not
        like an “airhead”) and energetic.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">When you have succeeded at both parts of this test&mdash;increasing
        and decreasing the amount of elemental Earth within you&mdash;you will have mastered the element of Earth.
        However, if you do not succeed at it within a few days or weeks, don’t worry about it. Just keep practicing.
        Remember, initiation is a <span class="italic">beginning</span> , not an end. Continue with your studies in this
        course. Do not stop and wait until you perfect your mastery of the element. If you continue your exercises, it
        <span class="italic">will</span> happen. Be sure to record the results of your experiments, whether they are
        good, bad, or indifferent, in your magick diary.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Before starting this part of this lesson, go back and reread the
        sections on the Kabalah in the previous lesson. As you are noticing by now, I am stressing going over previously
        presented material. One of the reasons for this is that the information and techniques presented in this course
        are <span class="italic">cumulative</span>. New information, techniques, and rituals are based on what appeared
        in earlier lessons. If you don’t have the techniques down pat and don’t have the previous information “under
        your belt” and understood, you may not be able to properly perform new rituals or understand new material. In
        order to help overcome this problem, you may notice that some important points and concepts are repeated. This
        is done on purpose to stress that information, not to make this course longer. For me, the most important part

          <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">There is a scene in the classic movie <span class="italic">A
                Christmas Story</span> where the main character, Ralphie, after weeks of anxious waiting, finally gets
              his precious Little Orphan Annie decoder ring in the mail. He dutifully records a secret message from the
              radio program and goes into the only place with privacy, the bathroom (much to the consternation of his
              desperate family), to decode what he thought must be a vitally important message using the ring. Slowly he
              translates the message, only to discover that the important secret communiqué from the radio was just an
              advertisement. Ralphie’s combination of anger, disappointment, and frustration can be described in two
              words: he was “ticked off.”</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Back in the late nineteenth century, Aleister Crowley finally
              achieved his first initiation into what he thought was a true magickal group, the Hermetic Order of the
              Golden Dawn. As part of the initiation he was sworn to oaths that promised a horrible, dire fate if he
              ever gave away the order’s secrets. And what were those secrets? The Hebrew alphabet and the astrological
              zodiac. <span class="italic">Whaaat?</span> Was that it? Crowley was ticked off.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In fact, from a superficial understanding of these things, he

              secret: the Hebrew alphabet and astrology were interrelated and linked to magick. That information is
              commonplace among occultists today, but it was not known except in small magickal circles in the late
              1800s. His initation also provided him with the opportunity to meet, communicate with, and practice ritual

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There is another interesting phenomenon I’ve noticed that is
        especially valuable if some material didn’t quite make sense when you originally studied it. If you have not

        you than it did during your earlier readings. I have a theory about this.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Have you ever noticed how, when typing on a computer, the cursor
        sometimes “hangs” for a few seconds? If you continue typing, the computer eventually catches up and the words
        you typed rapidly appear on the screen. This is because the computer has to do some processing in some way and
        puts the work of displaying what you’ve typed on hold. I think the mind may function in a similar way. The first
        time you study something it may not make sense, but after the mind has had time to “process” the information, it
        becomes clear. Your mind has had the time to digest the information subconsciously and intuitively come to an
        understanding of what was previously described. This is another reason to periodically review all of the lessons
        in this course.</span></div>

                the Territory</span></span></div>
          <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
          <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">One of the constant difficulties faced by aspiring magicians is
              mistaking a map for the territory. Obviously if you are traveling across the country, you are not going to
              mistake a map for the actual roads on which you are driving. Besides, it might actually be easier to fold
              up some roads than it is to fold up a map!</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">However, descriptions of the way the universe and various
              aspects of the universe function are also nothing more than maps. They guide us through the territory and
              may give us a way to understand it, but they are not the territory themselves. We frequently talk about
              multiple “planes” of existence, but these planes are not separate locations. The concept merely gives us
              an easier way to understand and work with the reality. Or, how about this: we each only have one mind. We
              may talk about the conscious and unconscious minds, the id, ego, and super-conscious of Freud or the
              parent, child, and adult of transactional analysis, but they are only ways of understanding and working
              with the mind; they are not the mind itself.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Usually, if we think of roads, the map is something less
              physical&mdash;an easily destroyable piece of paper. In the case of Exercise 2, however, the physical
              world is a map, just a representation of the real essence of elemental Earth. Physical soil or earth is a
              map of archetypal elemental Earth. They are not the same. The map&mdash;the physical earth&mdash;is a
              limited representation of the territory&mdash;archetypal elemental Earth. It may give you a limited idea
              of the territory, but it is not the territory and should not be confused with the actual territory.</span>

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">We are going to be looking again at that central glyph of the Kabalah,
        the Tree of Life. There are many ways to study the Tree, and in this part of the lesson we are going to look at
        a few of the ways to analyze the symbol.</span></div>
    <h2 class="calibre29"><span class="calibre30">
        <span class="bold1">The Three Pillars</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Look at the image of Tree of Life on the next page. The figure has
        been divided into three large pillars. The pillar on the left is composed of the 3rd, 5th, and 8th Sephiroht,
        and is known as the “Pillar of Severity.” On the right, the pillar is composed of the 2nd, 4th, and 7th
        Sephiroht. Being opposite of the pillar on the left, the one on the right is known as the “Pillar of Mercy.”
        Balancing the two outer pillars is the Middle Pillar. It is composed of the 1st, 6th, 9th, and 10th Sephiroht,
        and is also known as the “Pillar of Mildness.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It is interesting to note that the Pillar of Severity, on the left, is
        considered to be female while the Pillar of Mercy is considered to be masculine; a reversal of what might be
        considered an archetypal norm. However, if you study Jungian theories of archetypes, you will find that just as
        there is the kind, helping, beneficial “Great Mother,” so, too, is there the feminine element that works against
        you, known as the “Terrible Mother.” See, for example, myths of evil older women (the Witch in “Hansel and
        Gretel”), and deceptive and powerful younger ones (Circe in <span class="italic">The Odyssey</span> ). As
        mentioned earlier, there appear to be some links between the Kabalah and the source of Indian Tantra, what I
        refer to as proto-Tantra. One of the most powerful Tantric images is that of the goddess Kali. She is viewed as
        strong and powerful, even violent and terrifying. But she is also kindly and loving&mdash;Kali Ma (mother Kali).
        Further, in Tantra, there is the view that archetypal female power is outgoing, electric, and stimulating while
        archetypal male power is receptive, magnetic, and calming. Female is force, male is form. The Kabalah seems to
        agree with this concept in some ways, such as in relation to the Three Pillars, but not in all situations. Be
        aware that both potentials are there.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre12"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">Tree of Life: The Three Pillars</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre13">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The next image is another version of the Tree of Life. On it, each
        Sephira has its name both in transliterated Hebrew and the English translation of the Hebrew. Compare the two
        versions of the Tree of Life and follow along as the meanings of the Pillars are described.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">The Pillar of Mercy.</span> To be merciful, we
        must have the Wisdom (2nd Sephira) to see the results of our actions and realize that Victory (7th Sephira) can
        come about through Wisdom and the ability to endure. We can show Mercy (4th Sephira) instead of a short temper,
        and achieve a desired Victory not through strength alone.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Think about this in terms of wars. No war was ever decided on the
        battlefield unless the enemy was completely obliterated. Battles bring people to the bargaining table and then
        the politicians determine the way to victory. If the peace agreements are wise, future wars can be eliminated
        and in time foes can become allies. See, for example, the peace agreements between Japan and the U.S. after
        World War II. If the peace agreements are not wise, future wars are inevitable. This happened to Germany after
        World War I when the victorious “Triple Entente” powers demanded enormous reparations from the losing Germany,
        partially causing the destruction of Germany’s economy and allowing the country to be taken over by Hitler and
        the Nazi party.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">The Pillar of Severity</span>. To be severe, we
        must have an Understanding (3rd Sephira) of the laws of the universe and the Strength (5th Sephira) to empower
        them justly, but never yielding to giving mercy, only justice. This will result in an outward display of power
        and Splendor (8th Sephira) that hides the lack of humanity and mercy residing beneath the surface.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">A person on this pillar is filled with what is called, in German,
        <span class="italic">Schadenfreude</span>, which is the taking of delight in the suffering of another. It’s not
        enough to be victorious, but you have to gloat at the failure or suffering of others. There’s no equivalent word
        in English. The closest concept I know of is the idea of being a “bad winner.” Unfortunately, many people live
        with this philosophy: it’s not enough for me to win, but I also have to see you in a state of misery. The
        problem with this attitude, of course, is that eventually, someone who is bigger and meaner than you will come
        around, and you will be that person’s victim.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">The Pillar of Mildness.</span> To be mild, we
        must realize that we live in the Kingdom (10th Sephira) of Earth and we are not gods. Therefore, in whatever we
        strive for we must seek a Foundation (9th Sephirah) of Beauty (6th Sephira) by trying to avoid the extremes of
        overseverity and too much mercy. In this way we can seek to Crown (1st Sephira) our efforts with success.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre2"><img alt="033" src="images/000143.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre12"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">Tree of Life</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre13">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Some people mistakenly think that we need to always be on the Middle
        Pillar. Unfortunately, this is not always possible. The entire Tree of Life, as a model for approaching the
        world, shows that we need to be able to tap into any of the pillars when necessary. Sometimes we need to be
        severe, for it would be foolish to be weak in the face of evil. At other times it may just be foolish to get
        upset over minor issues, and it is wiser to let them go. At the end of the day, however, finding oneself
        approaching the world from the vantage point of the Middle Pillar brings the greatest and longest-lasting
        rewards to our world, our personal kingdom.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">So this, then, is one way to understand the Tree of Life, the system
        of the Three Pillars. If we are not successful in our efforts toward achieving any particular goal, we can see
        where we are unbalanced, i.e., focused toward one side of the Tree. We can then seek to add some of the
        balancing characteristics from the opposite side of the Tree. The result moves us to the center, toward the
        Pillar of Mildness, which could also be called the Pillar of True Manifestation.</span></div>
    <h2 class="calibre29"><span class="calibre30">
        <span class="bold1">The Three Triangles</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">The next system of looking at the Tree is known as the Three
        Triangles. As can be seen from the diagram on the next page, the Tree of Life can be divided into three
        triangles, the top one pointing upward and the other two pointing downward.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">The Celestial Triangle</span>. The uppermost
        triangle, composed of the first three Sephiroht, is known as the Celestial Triangle. It starts at a single
        point, which means that it comes from the unity of God and divides into two sides. This shows that although
        Divinity is a unity, everything which manifests can be seen in the form of a duality: male and female, up and
        down, in and out, hot and cold, magnetic and electric, force and form, etc. It is one of the duties of a
        magician to learn to overcome everything that seems to be in opposition in order to achieve unity with Divinity.
        (This is an ancient secret of the Kabalah and is understood by Tantrics. It will be discussed in a later
        lesson.) As an example, the magician must learn that day is not opposite to night, but rather both day and night
        are a natural part of the Earth’s spinning on its axis. Also, it is in this uppermost triangle that we can see
        those qualities of beings who are truly celestial in nature. They have Wisdom and Understanding. Thus, they are
        capable of wearing the Crown of creation and rule both the visible, physical world, and the higher planes of
        existence.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre2"><img alt="034" src="images/000178.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre12"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">The Three Triangles</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre13">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It should also be noted that from the single point of the Divine,
        there is an even division to the two sides of this triangle, male and female. It is evenly balanced. Some have
        claimed that the Kabalah is sexist. I would deny this completely. The Kabalah is definitely not sexist, although
        some Kabalists and Kabalistic writers, often reflecting their time and environment more than the Kabalah,
        definitely present sexist ideas. That should be seen as a reflection on them, not on the Kabalah.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">The Moral Triangle</span>. The central triangle
        which points down is called the Moral Triangle. A combination of Strength and Mercy results in the development
        of Beauty. If we have too much mercy, we become weak and unable to complete our goals. People take advantage of
        us, and we die young. On the other hand, if we show only strength and are totally unmerciful, we might be able
        to achieve our goals (although never without difficulty), but we will have no friends, have no real love, and
        our “success” becomes meaningless. By developing Strength <span class="italic">and</span> Mercy we exhibit a
        Beauty that aids us in achieving all of our goals, and gives us happiness in what we do achieve. Thus, the sides
        of this triangle should guide us and form what is called the “moral compass.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">The Mundane Triangle</span>. The lowest triangle
        is called the Mundane Triangle. It is an apt name. It concerns physical plane successes only, not mental and
        spiritual ones as are found in the Moral and Celestial triangles. Here, a Victory followed by too much Mercy
        leads to defeat, while the Splendor of a Victory, if not tempered with Mercy, leads to revolution and ruin. When
        balanced, a Foundation for success in this world exists and a Kingdom, as represented by the one Sephira hanging
        pendant to the Three Triangles, may be founded.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre2"><img alt="035" src="images/000001.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre12"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">The Path of the Arrow</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre13">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As you can see, each system of understanding the Tree of Life helps to
        explain the other systems. Go back for a second and look at the diagram of the Three Pillars. We can say that
        the path of a mystic or Yogi, whose intent it is to rejoin with the Divine (at Keter, the 1st Sephira), follows
        the Middle Pillar. This path, sometimes known as the “Path of the Arrow,” as shown on the previous page, is like
        the path an arrow flies if pointed straight up from Mahlkoot to Keter. The yogi sits in meditation until he or
        she can simply “hop” from the lowest to the highest.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">From reading the previous sections, you should be able to understand
        how a magician needs full access to all of the Sephiroht of the Tree, not just the middle pillar. A magician
        follows a path that can take him or her from Sephira to Sephira, going through and learning about each one while
        also covering each of the connecting twenty-two paths, winding about like a snake. In fact, the path of the
        magician is sometimes known as the <span class="italic">Path of the Serpent</span>. At each Sephira, on each of
        the connecting paths, the magician learns new things and has new and exciting experiences, which the mystic or
        yogi will never know. The yogi merely sits in meditation until ready to make the jump to the top of the Tree.
        The magician takes a more circuitous route. Each can achieve the goal of unity with Divinity&mdash;White
        Magick&mdash;in the same amount of time. It is their own determination and abilities that speed or delay the
        coming of unity, of Nirvana, of the ultimate mystical ecstasy ceremonial magicians refer to as obtaining “the
        Knowledge and Conversation of Your Holy Guardian Angel.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I like to use an understanding of the Three Triangles as a basis for
        psychology. By understanding which Sephira a person is “at,” I can recommend what the person needs to do for
        improvement. If, for example, a person always finds himself or herself being taken advantage of, I believe that
        person to be “in” the Sephira Hesed, number 4, Mercy. That person needs to develop more inner strength, strength
        enough to say “No!” to someone who is trying to take advantage of him or her. Then, instead of being the person
        everyone thinks of as being a sucker, people will be able to learn for the first time what he or she thinks
        about, cares about, and wants to do. They will see this person for the beautiful entity that person is.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Beware, again, of mistaking the map for the territory. What I
        described here is only a representation. Nobody is ever psychologically “in” a Sephira. This just provides a
        model that can help in obtaining one of the most powerful forms of magick in the world: personal change.</span>
    </div>
    <h2 class="calibre29"><span class="calibre30">
        <span class="bold1">The Four Worlds</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Another method of looking at the Tree is called the method of the Four
        Worlds. Look at the diagram on the next page showing one of the systems of understanding the Four Worlds.
        Dividing lines have been drawn between the triangles, as previously described. Thus, each triangle and the
        single tenth Sephira represents a “World.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The topmost triangle, composed of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Sephiroht, is
        known as Ha-oh-lam Atziloot, which means the World of Archetypes, or Emanations. It is the Divine world wherein
        exist the thoughts of God. It is in this world that the aspects of the powers of God, as represented by the
        Names of God, are said to exist.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The middle triangle, composed of the 4th, 5th, and 6th Sephiroht, is
        known as Ha-oh-lahm B’riyah, which means the World of Creation. It is not yet real in a physical sense; it is
        far more of the conscious mind. It is in this world that the archangels are said to exist.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The bottommost triangle is formed of the 7th, 8th, and 9th Sephiroht
        and is known as Ha-oh-lahm Yetzirah, or the World of Formation. It is considered by some to be equal to the
        astral plane, which is the basis for everything that exists in the physical universe. It is in this world that
        the various “orders” of angels are said to exist.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The 10th Sephira in this system all by itself forms Ha-oh-lahm
        Ahssiah, the World of Action. It is the world wherein the four elements, and hence the physical universe, exist
        and wherein physical action can occur.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre2"><img alt="036" src="images/000041.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre12"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">The Four Worlds</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre13">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">But what good does this Four Worlds system do? Let us assume that God
        wishes to create a universe. The first thing God would need to do is perceive the need for something. Here God
        is operating in the world of Atziloot. Next, God would see that a universe composed of Air, Earth, Fire, Water,
        and living things was necessary. Here God would be operating in the world of B’ri-yah. Next God would begin
        doing whatever was necessary to create the universe. Here God would be operating in the world of Yetzirah.
        Finally, God would put life and action into the formed parts of the universe, and would be operating in the
        world of Ahssiah.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">But this course is about practical magick. How does this information
        apply to us and how can we use it on a practical level? Let us say that you need something to hold your papers
        and notes when doing a ritual. You see a need, and therefore are in the world of Atziloot. Next, you begin to
        visualize it. It is made of wood, higher in the back than in the front so that the papers are at a nice angle,
        and there is a ledge at the bottom of the front so that the papers do not slide off. A battery-powered light
        illuminates the papers. Here you are in the world of B’riyah as you “create” the stand in your mind. Now you go
        out and buy the wood, cut it to size, assemble the stand, and finish it with an attractive and appropriate paint
        job. Here you are in the world of Formation, Ha-oh-lahm Yetzirah. Finally, you put it to use, and you are then
        operating in the world of Ahssiah. <span class="italic">If you have ever desired anything but have not been able
          to bring it into your own world, then it is most likely that you have overlooked the importance of one of the
          Four Worlds.</span> We will learn more about the process of bringing things into our lives (Grey Magick) in
        later lessons.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As stated earlier, the Kabalah has changed over time and has not been
        a static, unchanging system. There are other versions of the Four Worlds. One system holds that the divisions of
        the Four Worlds should show only the topmost Sephira, Keter, as being in the first World. The next two Sephiroht
        are in the second World. Sephiroht four through nine make up the third World of Yetzirah, and the fourth World
        is made up only of the final Sephira, Mahl-koot.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Another system holds that there is a full Tree of Life within each
        Sephira on the Tree of Life! Thus, there would be 100 Sephiroht to deal with. You could have Keter in Keter,
        Hochma in Keter, and up to ten different Sephiroht in each Sephira. With this system the Worlds get quite
        complicated.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Yet another system puts four Trees of Life on top of each other, with
        each Tree representing a world (see the diagram on the next page). In this system there are forty Sephiroht.
        Finally, another system says that there is a full Tree of Life within each of the 40 Sephiroht for a total of
        400 Sephiroht! Although going into detail on the meaning of this last system is far too advanced and complicated
        for this course, you might wish to spend some time contemplating the different Worlds and the various ideas of
        Trees of Life within the Sephiroht.</span></div>

      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">This section is a very special part of this course. What this part of
        the lesson consists of is simple, safe, and practical information on what meditation is and on how to meditate.
        Although you are encouraged to meditate on a daily basis as a necessary part of your own spiritual development,
        you are free to practice the technique given here as you will. It is not part of your suggested daily ritual
        practice. I do strongly suggest, however, that you either make time to practice it daily for at least several
        months, or just include it as part of your daily ritual.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In recent years there has been quite a furor concerning how to
        meditate and the benefits you can obtain from the practice of meditation. Recently, I saw a show on TV where two
        sleight-of-hand magicians tried to debunk the value of meditation. That’s sort of like hiring a garbage
        collector to prove that brain surgery is useless! That show was a sad embarrassment.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There have been many books that have seen print over the last
        twenty-five years or so with titles such as <span class="italic">How to Meditate</span> or <span
          class="italic">One Hundred and One Ways to Meditate</span> or <span class="italic">Meditation for
          Idiots</span> or something similar. They wouldn’t have been published if there was no interest in meditation.
        Most of these books have good points and bad points, beginning with trying to define exactly what meditation is.
        Without a definition of what meditation is, you can hardly be taught how to do it!</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">One group of authors tried to equate meditation with contemplation or
        concentration. This is probably because (a) their teachers didn’t know any better, (b) they don’t know any
        better, or (c) they simply looked up the meaning of the word “meditation” in a dictionary.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Most English dictionaries will define meditation as some form of
        contemplation. The two words are seemingly almost synonyms. Thus, those teachers who equate meditation with
        contemplation would have you simply look at an object, listen to a sound, or contemplate a thought and call it
        meditation. It is not.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">Meditation as it really exists is derived from an Eastern idea based not on contemplation,
        but silence&mdash;the silence of the mind. In his book <span class="italic">Meditation and the Bible</span>,
        Aryeh Kaplan clearly shows that techniques used by the ancient Hebrew mystics and prophets were similar to those
        of the ancient Indian mystics. Unfortunately, most of the ancient Hebrew techniques have been lost along with
        the writings of the Merkabah mystics. But here is the basic theory behind meditation:<div class="calibre20">
          <blockquote class="calibre21">
            <div class="calibre19">
              <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Try for a second to rid your mind of
                    all thought, to make it perfectly quiet. Unless you know what real meditation is and have practiced
                    it, it is inevitable that you will fail at this seemingly simple request. A voice will run through
                    your head saying such things as “There, I’m quiet now,” or “Am I doing this right?” or “How long do
                    I have to keep this up?”</span></span></div>
            </div>
          </blockquote>
        </div>
        <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre12"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">In true meditation</span>
        <span class="bold">the goal is to silence the inner voice.</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In another lesson we will learn that our unconscious (in this course
        the term “unconscious” is synonymous with “subconscious”) is our direct link to Divinity, to God. Since, by
        definition, God must be all knowledgeable (otherwise something else could be greater than God; if there is
        something greater than God, then that greater Thing must be the true God and what we have been calling God is
        only a false God or subordinate deity), our unconscious must have a link to all knowledge, to the secret wisdom
        of the universe, to enlightenment.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">But that little voice which constantly is speaking in our head usually
        shuts out the even smaller voice of our unconscious mind. One of the things that can occur in our dreams is that
        our unconscious speaks to us through symbols which are sometimes difficult to understand. In true meditation our
        unconscious can speak to our conscious directly, sharing its wisdom.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">What follows is a method for true meditation. There are other
        well-publicized schools of meditation that charge over a hundred dollars to teach you a technique for
        meditation. According to their website, the current cost to learn basic Transcendental Meditation is $2,000.00
        US, and they have more advanced courses that cost more. There is nothing wrong with these courses and some of
        them are very good. Unfortunately, some of these schools brag about how their techniques result in lowered blood
        pressure and increased IQs. This bragging is absurd. Any form of relaxation (such as the Relaxation Ritual) will
        result in lowered blood pressure. Also, the same social scientists who used to say a person’s IQ did not change
        over a lifetime are now teaching classes in how to raise your IQ through study and concentration.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Although true meditation will have the effect of increasing one’s IQ
        and lowering blood pressure, these are merely additional side benefits. The true benefit of real meditation is
        the experience of oneness with Divinity; that form of White Magick known as enlightenment or cosmic
        consciousness.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">True meditation has three steps:</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">1. Relaxation</span>. The purpose of this step is
        to get rid of any physical tension or pain so that the physical body will not get in the way of the next
        steps.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">2. Contemplation</span>. The purpose of this step
        is to completely unite your consciousness with a sound, object, idea, drawing, etc. Notice that relaxation and
        contemplation are both <span class="italic">parts</span> of true meditation, but do not constitute the
        whole.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">3. Negation</span>. In this step (the step which
        is usually left out of lessons on how to meditate), you eliminate from your mind all consciousness of what you
        have been contemplating. Since your consciousness has become united with what you have been contemplating, it
        (your consciousness) also leaves when you get rid of the object of your contemplation. The result is a state
        wherein your consciousness is not blocking the already existent link between you and the Divine. This is White
        Magick, the state of true bliss, and is the ultimate and only goal of true meditation. Unless one tries it and
        achieves the true meditative state, no words can fully explain it. It is beyond conscious communication of
        thought.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">In the following form of meditation, you will be focusing on a
        familiar object. Some traditional books would have you meditate on the ancient Indian Tantric Tattva or Tattwa
        symbols. These are specially colored geometric figures including triangles, squares, and ovoid shapes, which
        represent the elements. A traditional pre-Kabalistic system is to focus on the first letter of the Hebrew
        alphabet. While this may have been fine for cultures where visual stimulation was not as complex as in Western
        film and television-loving cultures, or in modern cultures used to working with those symbols, I have found
        through personal work and research done during my classes that Westerners often need something different,
        something more visually complex. That is what is offered here.</span></div>

        <span class="bold1">A Technique of True Meditation</span>

    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP ONE</span>. Perform the Relaxation
        Ritual.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP THREE</span>. Shuffle the Major Arcana cards
        (practice this for several weeks with cards 6, 7, 10, 13, 15, and 18 left out) and randomly select one to use.
        This will be the object that you will use for the contemplation part of this technique.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP FOUR</span>. If you feel the need, do the
        Relaxation Ritual again.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP FIVE</span>. <span
          class="italic">Scanning</span>: This step works in a way similar in nature to the method by which an old
        television with a big picture tube produces an image. In a picture tube is a device called an “electron gun,”
        which shoots electrons in a small single beam toward the screen, forming a “scan line” across the front of the
        tube. The beam from the electron gun then jumps back to just below the first line and repeats the process. If
        you look closely at the front of such a TV set when it is on, you can see the lines. You cannot see the lines as
        they are made because the process is done so fast that your eye cannot follow it. This speed, combined with the
        way your mind holds on to a picture, is what gives the appearance that you have a solid and moving picture on
        your TV.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">In this meditation technique, scanning is done this way:<div class="calibre24">
          <div class="calibre25">

                inch in height, from the top of the strip to the bottom. Move your vision from right to left across the
                width of the card. Thus you should have a strip of the card in your mind composed of the uppermost
                half-inch of the card.</span></blockquote>
          </div>
          <div class="calibre25">
            <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">3. Now return to the right-hand side of the card and
                scan again across the card, from right to left, covering another half-inch strip immediately below your
                previous scan.</span></blockquote>
          </div>
          <div class="calibre25">
            <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">4. Repeat this process until you have totally covered

        <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">What you are doing is observing the card, from top to bottom, a half
        inch at a time. Try to remember as much of each strip or “scan” as you can, but don’t worry about perfection.
        You will get better with practice. See the image at the top of the following page.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP SIX. Contemplation</span>: In this step you
        will become fully involved with the object. Put simply, the technique is to reproduce the previous step of

    <div class="calibre24">
      <div class="calibre25">

    <div class="calibre13">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Go one strip at a time until you have reproduced&mdash;in your
        imagination and to the best of your ability&mdash;the entire card. The first time you do this, and for many
        times to follow, you will probably miss many symbols, images, and colors, and perhaps you will only be able to
        recall and mentally create the outline of larger shapes that were on the card. It is not important that you are
        completely accurate with your visualization, but your visualization abilities will improve with this practice.
        This does not mean that it is permissible to be lazy or overly brief in this process. You must do the very best
        that you can. This step should take between three and four minutes, but if you wish it may take longer.</span>

                scanned and, moving from right to left, erase the image. That is, you “de-scan” it; you make that first
                and topmost strip disappear. In your mind’s eye you should still see a card, but with its top half-inch
                being removed.</span></blockquote>

            <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">3. Continue this de-scanning, erasing process until the
                entire card is gone from your mind. Duration for this step: about one and one-half to three minutes,

    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP EIGHT. The State of True Meditation</span>:
        At this point, a very interesting phenomenon will occur. Your consciousness, which has been caught up in the act
        of scanning and de-scanning the visualized card, will also be “gone” (actually it will only be silent) by the
        time the card is gone. Your consciousness will be silent and the monologue in your head will be stopped. This
        will give your unconscious a chance to speak to you and give you possibly important messages and
        information.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">When you first try this process, it is common for the true meditative
        state to last for only a brief instant. The inner voice returns and asks something like, “Am I silent? Did I do
        this right?” As soon as the voice comes back, the meditation is over.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As you practice this technique you will be able to make that instant
        of true meditation last a minute, five minutes, or more. As this state stretches out in length you will have a
        new feeling come over you, a feeling of being in total harmony with the universe, of having all knowledge and
        knowing that although things must evolve to a better state, all things are exactly as they should be at this
        instant in time. This is known as cosmic consciousness or enlightenment. It is, as I have said, really
        impossible to speak of this state of feeling, this state of existence. You must experience it and discover its
        beauty for yourself.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As stated at the beginning of this section, it is not required that
        you practice meditation. Nor is it required that you practice this particular method of meditation. However,
        sooner or later you will come to realize that meditation should become a part of your daily life. When you do
        decide to meditate on a regular basis, if you choose to use another system of meditation than is described here,
        do not deceive yourself into thinking that you are really meditating if all you are doing is concentrating or
        relaxing. Those are aspects of true meditation, but they are not meditation in and of themselves.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Also, you will find that all of your rituals and exercises will be
        greatly improved by practicing true meditation.</span></div>

        </span></span></h1>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">In this portion we will be focusing on what is known as the “unwritten
        Kabalah.” On the next two pages you will find a list of correspondences; that is, a list of how various things
        and ideas correspond with the Sephiroht on the Tree of Life. In this section you will learn the information
        necessary to understand the list.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As you can see, by the left of each row are the numbers 1 through 10.
        These, as you probably guessed, represent the numbers associated with each of the Sephiroht. The first column
        gives the name of each Sephira as they would be pronounced in Hebrew. The next column gives the translation of
        those names into English. I would like to mention here that some texts, especially those written for a primarily
        Jewish readership, sometimes give alternate names and/or spellings for the Sephiroht. For example, Giburah is
        frequently called “Pachad,” which means “fear.” It may also be spelled “Givurah.” However, this type of study
        falls more appropriately under the subject of the dogmatic Kabalah that, for the most part, is beyond the scope
        and purpose of the present course.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The third column is labeled “Color (Q.S.).” Kabalistically, there are
        four sets of colors (one for each of the four Kabalistic Worlds) that are related to the Sephiroht. They are
        named after the court cards of the Minor Arcana of the Tarot. In the Golden Dawn, initiates were expected to
        know all of the color scales. However, for our purposes, the most important version of the colors for the ten
        Sephiroht is called the Queen Scale (hence the “Q.S.”), which are the colors given here.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The Queen Scale colors are associated with the world known as
        B’ri-yah. Traditionally it is believed that it is more important to become familiar with the Queen Scale
        sephirotic colors than with the other scales of color. Note that there are four colors associated with the 10th
        Sephira. This is because the 10th Sephira relates to the Earth, the world of the four archetypal elements: Air,
        Earth, Fire, and Water. By now you should be beginning to become familiar with the element Earth as a result of
        the exercises given earlier in this lesson. You will become familiar with the other elements later in this
        course.</span></div>

        processes. For the colors, color in each Sephira with the appropriate color. The 10th Sephira has an “X” drawn
        through it and should be colored in like this:<div class="calibre2"><img alt="041" src="images/000030.jpg"

        the Sephiroht. Note that the association for the 5th Sephira, Giburah, is listed as tobacco. Today there are so
        many adulterants allowed to be added to tobacco that its purity, and therefore its value, is questionable. It
        was originally chosen, according to Aleister Crowley, because tobacco is said to be the favorite “scent” of men
        who work hard, and Giburah does mean “strength.” For a long time I questioned the value of tobacco as a magickal
        incense, as I would usually just open up a cigarette and drop the generally awful-smelling stuff on a block of
        hot charcoal. Then one day I went into a shop that sells wide varieties of tobacco for pipe smokers. Here I
        found several relatively untainted tobaccos, which have worked excellently for me. Try finding some you like,
        some of which give you a feeling of strength and power, the essence of Giburah. <span class="italic">You will
          NEVER become a magician if all you can do is blindly follow obsolete patterns.</span> Tradition can only be a
        guide.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In fact, it would be appropriate to use any scent that gives you that
        feeling of strength and power, whether or not it contains tobacco. In a similar manner you can “correct” any of
        the listings on the chart of Kabalistic correspondences so that it is correct for you.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It should be apparent to you at this point that I tend to be eclectic
        in my beliefs and I welcome change and newness. However, some of the correspondences date back thousands of
        years. They have lasted this long for only one reason: the thousands of people who have used them have
        discovered that they are accurate and that they work. Thus, although I do hope that you will closely examine and
        work with all of the correspondences, you should have a good, thoughtful, and valid reason for changing what has
        worked for so many for so long.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The next column relates the Sephiroht to the chakras. Because many
        people are familiar with the chakras, I have included them here as another way of becoming familiar with the
        Sephiroht. Unfortunately, deep study of the chakras is not really part of the curricula of this course. If the
        chakras interest you and you would like to do more study on them, consult the bibliography for books that go
        into detail on the subject.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The next column gives the God name associated with each Sephira.
        Remember, although there are many God names, these refer to aspects of a monotheistic deity, not to a
        polytheistic pantheon. In other words, they represent the faces or potencies of a singular deity. Note here, as
        shown in the parenthetical note on the page of Kabalistic correspondences, that when you see the letters “YHVH”
        as a God name they should be pronounced “Yud-Heh-Vahv-Heh.” Otherwise, the column is self-explanatory.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">We have already shown how the Sephiroht can be related to the physical
        body. That is, a person is seen as backing into the Tree of Life. The next column gives the traditional
        associations. This is followed by a column listing the planets. Note that the first Sephira is associated with
        “1st Swirlings.” This may refer to the original big bang which formed our physical universe, or it may refer to
        the galactic gas clouds that, due to gravity, condensed and began to spin. They eventually formed the galaxies
        and individual star systems. Or, it may refer to something altogether different. It will not be a vital part of
        our magickal system, so it is not an essential bit of knowledge. The second Sephira is related to the entire
        zodiacal belt, not to a planet as such. The tenth Sephira, which is related to the planet Earth, is also the
        sphere of the four archetypal elements.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The next column gives the metals associated with the Sephiroht. Notice
        here that the first, second, and tenth Sephiroht have no metallic associations. This is followed by a column
        associating the Sephiroht with stones.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">The Kabalistic view of the higher planes shows a very ordered universe. Each entity or
        power essence has others in its command to do its bidding. A simple diagram of this would be as follows:<div
          class="calibre2"><img alt="042" src="images/000074.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>
        <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The aspects of Divinity are represented by the God names. The angels
        are frequently dealt with in groups known as “orders.” The angels do the bidding of the archangels; the
        archangels obey God; God assigns the archangels tasks appropriate to their nature. The relationship an archangel
        has with Divinity is via the aspect of the Ultimate Source, which is represented by the God names. The whole,
        rather militaristic structure is controlled by the unknowable divinity, the Ain. You will find a column with the
        correspondences that gives the Hebrew names of the archangels followed by a column with the translations of the
        Hebrew names.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The next column relates to the personality or “soul,” and has already
        been discussed. It is presented here in brief, and much more detail will be added at a later time. This is
        followed by the transliteration of the Hebrew, giving the Hebrew sounds in English. This is followed by a
        listing of the Angelic Orders, and then by the translations of those Hebrew terms.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It is interesting to note that several of the names of the orders of
        angels are terms used by Ezekiel in his revelation. If you understand traditional Hebrew mysticism, the mystical
        book of Ezekiel becomes easier to comprehend. If you do not, you can come up with absurd theories as one NASA
        scientist did, claiming that Ezekiel saw an alien space vehicle. He claimed that the descriptions Ezekiel used
        were merely a way of reporting the action of the space ship! He failed to see that his interpretation of Ezekiel
        was his way of trying to understand mystical terms without including mysticism. That would be like trying to
        describe the recipe of a cake while claiming that flour was really “flower” and you should grind up petals from
        a rose in order to make devil’s food cake!</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Coming back to Earth, most scholars believe that this angelic
        train-of-command was copied from various Semitic peoples who had long lists of djinns and the like.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Next come the magickally important Hebrew letters Yud-Heh-Vahv-Heh,
        YHVH for short, the Tetragrammaton. I have already discussed it, but let’s add some more information. The Yud
        looks like this: <img alt="207" src="images/000116.jpg" class="calibre11" />. The upper tip of the Yud is
        associated with the first Sephira. The rest of the Yud, along with the Heh (which looks like this: <img
          alt="043" src="images/000151.jpg" class="calibre11" />), is associated with the second through fourth
        Sephiroht. The Vahv is an elongated Yud and looks like this: <img alt="208" src="images/000192.jpg"
          class="calibre11" />. It is related to the fourth through ninth Sephiroht. Notice the overlap between the Vahv
        and Heh. The second or last Heh is related to the tenth Sephira. The first Heh is known as the Heh Superior
        (Sup.) and the second Heh is known as the Heh Inferior (Inf.).</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">Hebrew is read from right to left, and the Tetragrammaton looks like this:<div
          class="calibre2"><img alt="044" src="images/000018.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>
        <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">Vertically, it looks like this:<div class="calibre2"><img alt="045" src="images/000057.jpg"
            class="calibre11" /></div>
        <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The creatures in the next column are both real and unreal, while the
        tools of the following column are magickal tools. The lamen is a medallion hung around the neck to represent a
        certain power or quality. The names are the various God, archangelic, and angelic names, along with other words
        of power. The traditional magician of the Middle Ages wore two robes: an outer robe, representing the silence
        necessary to being a magician, which concealed a hidden, inner robe of truth. Today, most magicians wear only
        one robe, the two robes being more symbolic than actual.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Finally, the last column is self-explanatory with the sole added note
        that the plant associated with the first Sephira is an almond “aflower.” That is, it should be blooming.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This list of Kabalistic correspondences is by no means complete. But
        it is a good start. I suggest that you make up a series of Trees of Life, each one filled out with one of the
        columns. You may wish also to make up a very large Tree of Life putting many of the correspondences associated
        with a Sephira in the drawing of that Sephira. I urge a deep study of the correspondences now. Their importance
        will become clearer to you as we move into the study of Grey Magick. For a far more complete version of these
        correspondences, get <span class="italic">777</span> by Aleister Crowley, <span class="italic">Godwin’s
          Cabalistic Encyclopedia</span> by David Godwin, or <span class="italic">The Complete Magician’s Tables</span>
        by Stephen Skinner. These books are vital encyclopedias necessary for research performed by a modern practicing
        ceremonial magician.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">If you feel you have been successful with the Middle Pillar Ritual,
        you may go on to an advanced version of the ritual. Visualize each Sephira, each power center, in the colors
        given on the correspondence list. Dah-aht is lavender, and for Mahl-koot use black. The Sephiroht should be
        connected with a beam of white light. You may also vibrate the name of the archangel after vibrating the God
        name. Dah-aht at the throat does not have a Kabalistic archangelic name, so we borrow from another language
        called Enochian or Angelic. Use: El-ex-ar-peh Co-mah-nah-nu Tahb-ih-toh-ehm.</span></div>
    <h2 class="calibre29"><span class="calibre30">
        <span class="bold1">The Circulation of the Body of Light</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">While the advanced Middle Pillar Ritual is a valuable addition to your
        practices, its success will depend in part upon your visualization abilities. Visualization, in this sense, does
        not necessarily mean that you must “see” the colors. Rather, it could mean that you “know” or “feel” that the
        colors are there. This does not mean “hope” they are there&mdash;you must know that if your astral vision were
        open you would easily be able to see the colors in your mind’s eye. You must <span class="italic">know</span>
        that the colors <span class="italic">are</span> there whether you see them or not.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Even if you have not mastered the advanced version of the Middle
        Pillar Ritual as given above, you should now add a new ritual to your daily practice. It should add no more than
        two or three minutes to the total time of your daily work. There are three parts to it.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Start by doing the same daily practices you have done up to now: the
        Relaxation Ritual, the LBRP, and the Middle Pillar Ritual. However&mdash;and this is important&mdash;do <span
          class="italic">not</span> visualize the Middle Pillar vanishing. Keep the pillar in your mind’s eye as strong
        as possible.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">FIRST PART</span>. While keeping the
        visualization of the Middle Pillar, refocus your attention on Keter, the white brilliance just above your head.
        Visualize this brilliance in a state of extreme strength, needing to radiate out even more energy. Visualize it
        sending a current of energy down into the head and to the <span class="italic">left</span> shoulder. Let this
        energy pass down the left side of your body to your left foot. Feel it move to your right foot, up the right
        side of your body, to your head, and back up to Keter.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This motion should be synchronized with your breath. When you exhale,
        feel the energy go down your left side. When you inhale, feel the energy go up your right side. You should have
        the sensation of a circle of energy swirling around you. Move the energy, with your breath, in six to ten
        cycles&mdash;more if you like.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Feel free to expand the energy further out to the sides, to the ends
        of the universe, if you wish. Most commonly, it is seen as going out about three feet from the body. You might
        also wish to experiment with what happens if you contract the energy so that it goes down the left side of the
        spine and up the right side of the spine.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">SECOND PART</span>. This immediately follows the
        first part of this ritual. It is similar to that part, but instead of directing the energy down one side and up
        the other, here you should direct the energy down the <span class="italic">front</span> of your body and up the
        back. Be sure to synchronize your breath so that as you exhale the energy goes down the front of your body and,
        as you inhale, it goes up your back, to your head and up to Keter. Repeat six to ten times.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">THIRD PART: “THE MUMMY.”</span> This immediately
        follows the second part of this ritual. Revisualize the entire Middle Pillar. This time, focus your attention on
        Mahl-koot, at the feet. From the upper right side of this spherical power center, <span class="italic">visualize
          the energy curling up in a tight spiral to the front of the left leg</span>. From here it continues around the
        back and moves upward in a counter-clockwise spiral around your body. It is as if you are being wrapped like an
        Egyptian mummy, from the feet to the head. Instead of cloth, however, you are being wrapped in spiraling
        energy.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">You should feel a whirling of spiritual power as the pure spiritual
        light and energy rises up in spirals from your feet to above your head, from Mahl-koot to Keter. At Keter you
        should visualize the energy exploding out like a water fountain in all directions. This energy lands at your
        feet and begins to rise in the spiral again. As you inhale, feel the energy rise toward Keter. As you exhale,
        feel it explode outward toward Mahl-koot at your feet. As in the first and second parts, do it for six to ten
        cycles or more if you wish. Then, take a very deep breath, and as you exhale, see the energy disappear visually,
        but know that it is still there, invisibly.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Finish by doing the Tarot Contemplation Ritual and filling out your
        ritual diary.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Warning</span>: Although it sounds simple and
        rather benign, the Circulation of the Body of Light is a very powerful ritual. You may rock back and forth, feel
        dizzy, or even fall over as a result of your direction of spiritual energy. The first time I tried this I
        literally fell to the ground, overcome with the energy. I know that if people are just reading this or have
        jumped to this section without practicing the previous material for two or more months, this may sound absurd.
        And to you, it will be absurd. But if you have actually performed all the work and all the practices described
        previously, you will discover that I am not understating what can happen. If anything, I’m understating just how
        <span class="italic">wang-boom!</span> powerful this ritual can be. If you do experience any of these phenomena,
        don’t get terrified or petrified. With a few days of practice you will be in control of that amazing
        energy.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In the Chinese yoga manual titled <span class="italic">The Secret of
          the Golden Flower</span> it says that “when the light circulates, the powers of the whole body arrange
        themselves before its throne, just as a holy king takes possession of a capital and lays down rules of order,
        and all approach with tribute. Therefore, you have only to make the Light circulate; that is the deepest and
        most wonderful secret. The light is easy to move, and if allowed to go long enough in a circle it crystallizes
        itself; it is this condition of which it is said ‘silently in the morning thou fliest upward.’”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">The energy used in the Circulation of the Body of Light ritual is so powerful that it can
        be used for healing purposes. Simply use visualization to direct the energy that you have learned to control
        down your arms and out through your hands. This healing technique is especially good for people who are drained
        and low on energy. It is good as an aid for people who are <span class="italic">recovering</span> from almost
        any physical ailment. It can be used without fear on people who have serious, chronic diseases. However, you
        should follow these rules:<div class="calibre24">

                is okay to help him or her recover faster. Place one hand on the forehead and the other on the lower

                energy. As soon as you sense that the person you are working on is filled with energy, do the LBRP to

        Life. I am not going to make any comments on it at this time. Rather, I want you to spend some time looking at
        it and trying to discover the relationships between the Tarot and the Kabalistic correspondences given earlier
        in the lesson. I am presenting it now, seemingly unrelated to the material in the preceding and following
        paragraphs, to draw attention to it. It may be the most important diagram for the magickal techniques that will
        be given later in this course. It will be explained later, at the proper time, but I want you to get some
        familiarity with it now so that it will not be something startlingly new when its importance becomes evident.
        Study it with your Tarot cards in hand and compare with what has already been given.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Before moving on to the next part of this lesson, there is another
        thing I wish to clarify for you. You may be thinking that I will be adding on to the basic daily rituals until
        you have no time to do anything else! This is not the case. There is only one more basic ritual that you must
        learn. Do not give up. Do not omit any part of the rituals. Do not skip a day unless it is <span
          class="italic">impossible</span> not to. Everything that you are now doing is White Magick, moving you toward
        unity with Divinity. It is also your preparation for doing Grey Magick. If you memorize the rituals they should
        not take longer than fifteen minutes. And, in a short time, this course will give you a method for doing the
        rituals anytime, anywhere, via a special mental process. It will take even less time to perform the rituals, and
        it will simultaneously give you more personal power. Don’t give up! You can do it and amazing things
        await.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The answer is that there is nothing wrong and that they are not
        failing. The energies involved in the rituals are continually at work throughout the physical and spiritual
        universe. The energy goes around and through all things, both physical and non-physical. It is everywhere. If
        you did not feel the motion of the energy before, there is no guarantee that you will sense it after you have
        begun practicing the rituals. Magick permits us to <span class="italic">utilize</span> these forces in ways
        non-magicians cannot comprehend. This does not depend upon whether you feel these energies.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It is not necessary that you have any weird experiences or unusual
        sensations as a result of the practice of the rituals in this course. If the rituals are done properly, the
        desired results must inevitably occur. If you throw a ball in the air, it must come down. This is the law of
        gravity, and the ball will come down even if you’re not consciously aware of any sensation due to gravity. If
        you do the rituals properly, you must get the desired results. This is the cosmic law of magick.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Sometimes, unusual experiences or sensations can actually get in the
        way of psychic development. Some people get sidetracked into trying to produce psychic phenomena. They end up
        spending time trying to do relatively useless things such as levitation or being able to see what symbol is on
        the back of a card. While spending time bending spoons (and what good is a bent spoon, anyway?) they ignore
        their magickal work and retard their magickal and spiritual progress.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">So, some of you may feel or sense the energies that have been
        described in this and in previous lessons. Some of you, for a while, may not. But, as Bill Murray chanted in the
        movie <span class="italic">Meatballs</span>, “It just doesn’t matter!” If you do the rituals properly, the
        magick will work.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Know</span> that you can do the rituals
        successfully. <span class="italic">Dare</span> to do them. Then just <span class="italic">Do</span> them!
        Finally, <span class="italic">Be Silent</span> about your achievements.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">In this section I am going to be discussing primarily the use of the
        magickal tool known as the pentacle and its construction. First, however, I need to discuss the system of the
        magickal elements.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As you may know, and as I have already briefly discussed, in the West
        we have a system of “four magickal elements.” Well, this is not true now, nor to my knowledge has it ever been
        true. As far as I can tell, calling our system a “four element” system is a blind to fool those outside the
        temples of wisdom.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">The fact is that there have always been five magickal elements. According to the <span
          class="italic">Sepher Yetzirah</span>, one of the oldest Kabalistic documents extant, their order is as
        follows:<div class="calibre20">
          <blockquote class="calibre21">
            <div class="calibre19">
              <div class="calibre12"><span class="calibre7">The <span class="italic">SPIRIT</span> of God <br

                    class="italic">WATER</span> emanated from Air <br class="calibre5" />Part of the water became <span

            </div>
          </blockquote>
        </div>
        <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Note that some people call the system as listed in the <span
          class="italic">Sepher Yetzirah</span> a “three element” system. This is because the element of Spirit is
        ignored and the element of Earth is not even considered a separately emanated element, but rather a mere part of
        elemental Water. Some later Kabalistic systems contend that elemental Earth is only a combination of Air and
        Water or a mixture of Air, Water, and Fire. In any event, even though elemental Earth may be considered a
        secondary element in the traditional Kabalah, it is still an element. Include Spirit and Earth with the Three
        Element Kabalistic system and we have our five elements of magick.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In the West the magickal four elements are frequently pictured around
        a pentagram. Isn’t it obvious that there must be a fifth element so that each point of the pentagram can have a
        magickal element associated with it? The missing element, of course, is the source of the other four elements,
        Spirit. Spirit is the source of all that exists and is the divine light from beyond Keter. These are the symbols
        of the five elements:</span></div>
    <div class="calibre2"><img alt="047" src="images/000140.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Below, the symbols of the elements show which element is associated
        with each point of the pentagram.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre2"><img alt="048" src="images/000179.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">But to get a really good idea as to how the elements interrelate, we must travel briefly to
        China. In Chinese mysticism there has never been a doubt or mislabeling of the number of elements of magick.
        They do have slightly different names, however, and here is how the Chinese and Western systems correspond:<div
          class="calibre2"><img alt="049" src="images/000002.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>
        <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">In the diagram below, you can see that the distribution of the Chinese elements around the
        pentagram are in a slightly different order than in the Western system shown above. But the Chinese system is
        well thought out. If you go clockwise around the pentagram of the five Oriental elements, you are following what
        is called “the Cycle of Creation or Generation.” Here is a symbolic explanation of this cycle:<div
          class="calibre2"><img alt="050" src="images/000042.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>
        <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Fire burns down things and they eventually become Earth.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Metals are mined from Earth.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Water comes through Metal pipes.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Wood is created from the vital nutrients in Water.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Fire comes from burning wood.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Obviously, this is a modern interpretation; however, it aids in
        remembering this cycle. If you follow the paths of the arms of the pentagram, you are following what is called
        “the Cycle of Control or Destruction.” Here is a modern explanation of this cycle:</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Fire purifies or destroys Metal.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Metal, in the form of an axe blade, forms or destroys Wood.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Wood tools can be used to control Earth.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Dams of Earth control Water.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Water extinguishes (destroys) Fire.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">Thus we can see in the Oriental system that a particular magickal element can be used to do
        one of three things:<div class="calibre24">
          <div class="calibre25">
            <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">1. Enhance itself (Fire + Fire = 2 Fire).</span>
            </blockquote>
          </div>
          <div class="calibre25">
            <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">2. Enhance another element (adding Fire to Wood
                increases Earth).</span></blockquote>
          </div>
          <div class="calibre25">
            <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">3. Counter another element (Water counters the effect
                of Fire).</span></blockquote>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Now that you’ve had a chance to see a thought-provoking system of
        working with the magickal elements, let me tell you that the Western system, in my opinion, is much easier,
        especially when discussing the elemental tools. The pentacle really has only two important purposes: it collects
        and directs the energies of elemental Earth. What you use the energy for, and how you use it, is up to you. If
        you feel lightheaded, it can ground you. If you feel that you are under psychic attack via the elements of
        Spirit, Air, Fire, or Water, it can reflect those energies back upon their source. If you are attacked using the
        element of Earth, it can either reflect the elemental energy or, even better, store it for your future positive
        use. Thus, for the operative magician, the pentacle is primarily a defensive weapon, meant never to be used as a
        weapon except in case of being attacked. It can also, as mentioned, be used to direct and store Earth energy for
        whatever purpose you desire.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The next problem for us&mdash;now that we know the purpose of the
        pentacle&mdash;is an appropriate construction. Most tradition-based books recommend using a disk of wood or
        metal up to nine inches in diameter. Now, as I have already said, this tool is also a defensive weapon. Grabbing
        a nine-inch circle of wood or metal and trying to direct it in the proper direction to dispel an attack on you
        would be like having someone jump you with a knife while you struggle to find a huge old shotgun that doesn’t
        even fire accurately!</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The answer to this problem is twofold. Firstly, an object six inches
        in diameter is far easier to use if you have average-sized hands. Secondly, if the object, instead of being
        flat, is <span class="italic">concave</span>, it will return any energy from any direction, back toward the
        direction from which it came. This creates a situation of “instant karma” for your attacker.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">What you can do is carve out (or buy) a shallow wooden bowl. The
        interior must be as perfectly concave as possible, although the back may be flat so that it can be balanced on a
        table or altar. A small ring of wood or metal placed on a table will allow you to balance a bowl with a round
        bottom on that table or altar. Metal can be used for your pentacle, but it is slightly harder to paint a
        metallic surface than a wooden one.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Lightly sand the surface and put on a white undercoat or primer. With
        a fine line brush draw an “X” from edge to edge on both sides of your pentacle. This should divide both surfaces
        into four large triangles. Paint these citrine, olive, black, and brown, as listed earlier in this lesson. Paint
        both sides. The black section on both sides should be directly opposite or back-to-back of each other. In this
        way when you hold the pentacle from the bottom you will be holding black on both sides of the pentacle. If the
        undercoat shows through, use a second coat.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Using a compass, draw a circle three-eighths of an inch from the outer
        edge of the pentacle. Paint the ring white from the line to the edge. Either freehand or with the aid of a
        compass, draw out a pentagram (or hexagram) so the points of the arms just touch the white ring that you have
        drawn on the front and back of the pentacle. The lines of the pentagram should be about three-eighths of an inch
        in width. If any of the background colors show through these white lines, keep adding coats of white paint until
        the white is opaque.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Next, fill in the circle with the Hebrew letters of the God name,
        angelic name, etc., and the appropriate sigils as given on the next page. These should be painted in dark black.
        Extra coats for the lettering may be necessary. The lettering should be black, not grey. Finally, cover the
        entire pentacle with a protective clear coat of lacquer. I suggest the use of Varathane liquid plastic
        gloss.</span></div>

          <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">So why did the Golden Dawn call this a pentacle, anyway, if it

          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Yes, it’s true that the prefix “pent” means “five,” and perhaps
              it might be best just to say that a pentagram is a five-pointed star and a pentacle is an object with a
              pentagram on it. The problem, as usual, is with language. You see, although we pronounced the words and
              spell them “pent-,” they may have a different source.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It is quite possible that pentacles were originally meant to be
              worn like some form of protective jewelry. In that case, the beginning of the word is derived from the
              prefix <span class="italic">pend</span>-, meaning something that hangs like a pendant.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Alternatively, the word “pentacle” may be derived from the Latin
              <span class="italic">pentaculum</span>, which may mean a “small painting,” such as is drawn on a talisman
              or, in this case, a pentacle. In that case almost anything could be on it.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Whatever the true source of the word, if you want to create a
              pentacle in the style of the Golden Dawn, paint a hexagram on it. If you are not making a Golden Dawn
              pentacle, there is no reason you cannot put a pentagram on your pentacle. Experiment and see what works
              best for you.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14">
      <div class="calibre19">Finally, if you notice, there is a space listed on the page for a “motto.” This is the
        Golden Dawn equivalent of a magickal name. Just as putting on your magickal robes tells your subconscious that
        something special is happening, so too does referring to yourself by your magickal name or motto add to this
        intuitive understanding. Today, magicians tend to take the choice of a magickal name or motto very seriously,
        often spending hours agonizing over just the right choice to represent their goal as a magician. Some magicians
        take the magickal names of someone they admire for their magickal ability, real or imagined, such as “Merlyn” or
        other historical or mythical characters. Some people, instead of a name per se, use a phrase representing
        something they stand for or believe. The Golden Dawn mottoes were usually in Latin, but any language will do.
        Here is a list of samples:<div class="calibre20">

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Members of the Golden Dawn, as well as in other magickal orders, will
        often refer to each other by the initials of their magickal mottoes in correspondence and within rituals. Thus,
        you would have Frater or Soror (brother or sister) D.D.C.F., D.E.D.I., S.A., etc. As you rise through the
        degrees of an order, some people change their motto. Often you will be entitled to use honorifics such as
        “Greatly Honored Frater,” too.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">English, Latin, Hebrew, Greek, Enochian, or any other language would
        be fine to use for your magickal name or motto. You should spend some time considering what name you will use.
        True, you can always change, but you will find that its choice will be important and more and more meaningful to
        you as you evolve magickally.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">One last thing in this part of the lesson. Although people today may
        look back in wonder at the members of the original Golden Dawn, it should be remembered that beside being great
        occultists, they were also just men and women doing the best they could to excel, just like you and me. You see,
        they had in their possession a large book of family mottoes. Most of the members simply took their longstanding
        family motto as their magickal motto. Others just looked through the book and selected a motto they liked. Oh
        my!</span></div>

      <div class="calibre19">Perhaps you have wondered what the difference is between “ceremonial” magick and “ritual”
        magick. Many people use them interchangeably as synonyms and, in fact, their dictionary definitions are quite
        similar. However, in magickal philosophy there is an important difference. Anyone can do a ritual. It can be a
        magickal ritual or a ritual of another kind, such as a shaving ritual wherein you shave yourself according to a
        certain pattern. After a period of practice, some rituals, such as a shaving ritual, become habits. To break the
        ritual, that is, to follow an unusual pattern, can cause problems. It can make you feel uncomfortable, and can
        possibly be harmful. If you don’t believe me, try shaving yourself in a different manner than usual. Start in a
        different location or shave in a different direction. But don’t be surprised-and don’t blame me!&mdash;if you
        end up cutting and nicking yourself in many places. This, then, gives you three important caveats:<div

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">My definition of a ceremony is a “group ritual.” That is, it only
        takes one person to do a ritual while it takes several people to perform a ceremony. Thus, in order to do
        ceremonial magick you must have a group of some sort.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Although all of the magickal techniques in this course will be
        presented so that they can be performed by the individual ritualist, in the future there will be notes given on
        how to do some rituals with a group. This leads to the question of the values and drawbacks of groups.</span>

    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The benefits of magickal groups are threefold:</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">1. <span class="italic">Camaraderie</span>. Sometimes, being a
        magician can be a lonely prospect, and it is nice to have friends who have similar interests. They can give you
        feedback on what you’re doing and give guidance. Even if you choose not to be part of a group, I urge you to
        consider attending an occasional festival or convention. Camaraderie and socialization, even for a short period
        of time, are very beneficial.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">2. <span class="italic">Specialization</span>. Everyone in a magickal
        group, to some degree, must have similar knowledge. That’s one of the things that holds groups together. No one,
        however, can be an expert in all fields of occultism. In a group, one person may be a specialist with the Tarot
        (although everyone in the group may be familiar with the Tarot), another a specialist in astrology, another in
        occult history, and another in ceremony and ritual. Thus, the more people you have, the greater the chance that
        a subject your group needs information on will be known by one of the members.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">3. <span class="italic">Power</span>. In spite of the fact that some people will deny it,
        the truth is that the more people you have, the higher the levels of psychic/magickal energy may be generated.
        Perhaps you have experienced the flows of energy at a rock concert or football game. This is nothing more than
        poorly controlled psychic or magickal energy. With magick we learn how to control this energy via the techniques
        you have been learning and further techniques to come. Obviously, the intensity is increased in proportion to
        the number of people present. Further, the amount of energy increases <span class="italic">exponentially</span>
        rather than via simple addition. This means that if one person generates “E” amount of psychic energy,<div

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As you can see, even a few people together can have a much stronger
        effect than a large number working individually. This, by the way, is not a theory I made up. It is based on
        Einstein’s field theories and is accepted by most occultists with whom I am familiar.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This does not mean, however, that having a group of people will
        automatically make you successful in your magickal work. A competent and experienced individual magician may be
        far more in control of the psycho-magickal energy than a group. Sometimes an individual may be more successful
        than a group for just this reason. This is also why I wrote above that a group of people <span
          class="italic">may</span> be able to generate more than an individual. Certainly a group of incompetents would
        not be able to outdo one well-trained magician.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This brings us to the challenges associated with groups. I had a close
        friend, a well-respected author of several books on magickal topics, who died several years ago. He believed
        that although you could have group rituals, the idea of working with a single group on a regular basis was
        obsolete and impractical. This opinion was due to his personal experience with some groups. I, too, have
        experienced much the same. Always, and I do mean <span class="italic">always</span>, the problems associated
        with groups are based on one problem and one problem only: personal psychology. Cliques form and people locked
        out of the cliques feel hurt and left out. Person A won’t work with person B because person B is too (a) smart,
        (b) dumb, (c) ugly, (d) beautiful, or (e) other. Somebody institutes plots against the leader. Somebody wants to
        change the group so that it fits his or her personal image of what the group should be rather than changing
        himself or herself so as to fit in with the group. It’s all so very stupid.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This sort of nonsense has gone on for years between groups too.
        Various groups calling themselves Rosicrucian all insist that only they are the real Rosicrucians and all of the
        other groups are frauds. Various Witchcraft and Wiccan groups involve themselves in this same sort of
        foolishness. One famous magickal group currently has about five or six people claiming to be the true leader of
        the organization, each leading their own group, and each claiming that the others are frauds and fakes. This
        disagreement has led to outrageous name-calling and expensive court cases. What can a person who wants to work
        with a group of others with similar interests do?</span></div>

          <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">It never fails that people will look through a large volume,

              inconsistencies. Well, if you want to look, go ahead.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">So earlier, in the section on dealing with psychic attack I
              wrote that you shouldn’t do mirror spells because you’d consciously be doing a form of Black Magick,
              sending negative energy to someone, and that would eventually have repercussions on you. Yet in the
              section on making a pentacle I advise making the pentacle concave so it would direct negative energy back
              to where it originated. Essentially, it would be a type of mirroring spell.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Now, I could just say that yes, this is an inconsistency, and

          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">However, this would be a “cop-out” and not represent the truth.
              In reality, there is no inconsistency and both of the original concepts are correct when taken <span
                class="italic">in context</span>. Even though <span class="italic">Modern Magick</span> covers a wide
              ground, it is still meant to take people from introductory level and intermediate level up to the point of
              preparing people to be advanced magicians. That means because I want to introduce you to all of this
              material, it is impossible to cover everything in depth and you should think about everything that is
              written.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The reason I advise against performing mirroring spells to
              oppose psychic attack is that the vast majority of such attacks may be unintended, accidental,
              self-created, or imagined. Turning negative energy on to someone who is simply angry with you and didn’t
              mean to hurt you is cruel and uncalled for. Turning it on yourself is just plain foolish.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In a situation where you would use the qualities of the Earth
              pentacle, you would be fully aware of who and where the negative energy is coming from. For the purposes
              as will be described later in this book, it would primarily be used with specific non-physical entities
              <span class="italic">after</span> you have tried other remedies. For a fictionalized version of its use,
              see my novel <span class="italic">The Resurrection Murders</span>.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">So, there is no contradiction here. Sorry. If you’re really into
              finding that sort of thing, you’ll have to keep looking.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">First, he or she can forget about the whole thing. But if that doesn’t
        work, he or she can start a group from scratch. Then, as more and more people become involved, each person, in
        the tradition of the Freemasons, must be accepted by all of the current members of the group before the person
        is allowed to join. Thus, the people must first meet on a social level before becoming involved on a magickal
        level. The group must be a small circle of friends. Some Witches claim the size of a magickal group should be no
        more than thirteen. Hence, thirteen is the maximum size of many covens.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Also, the goal of all the people in the magickal group must be
        unified. There must be no ulterior motives for any of the people being in the group. Israel Regardie strongly
        suggested that all people involved with occultism should go through psychotherapy. For a long time I felt that
        this was because he was a Reichian therapist. But because of my experience with many groups and with the
        experiences told to me by others, I am at a point now where I am inclined to agree with the good doctor.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Unfortunately, most of us have neither the time nor desire to go to
        some sort of therapist or counselor, and many people can’t afford it. Also, there is a wide degree of quality
        among therapists. Sometimes I think that many people became professional therapists in the hopes of solving
        their own deep mental problems, and, failing that, try to help others without recognizing that everything they
        do goes through the “filter” of their personal psychological issues. Don’t get me wrong, there are numerous
        wonderful, skilled, and dedicated counselors and therapists, but how will you know if you have a good one, a
        person who won’t begin by having you locked up for studying the occult?</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Luckily, there is an answer. It is a powerful therapeutic and magickal
        technique that can be used which I call the I.O.B.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5"><a id="calibre_link-44"></a></div>
    <h1 class="calibre27"><span class="calibre28"><span class="bold1">
          <span class="bold1">I.O.B.</span>
        </span></span></h1>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">The I.O.B. technique is not new, but it is a new interpretation of
        traditional Golden Dawn magickal techniques and medieval counseling techniques. The Golden Dawn aspect includes
        a simple version of the formulation of “telesmatic images” and certain banishing techniques. The medieval
        counseling technique is commonly called “exorcism.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Of course, ever since the movie <span class="italic">The
          Exorcist</span>, people have become familiar with the idea of exorcism, or at least an exaggerated and
        fictionalized idea of the process. It is commonly thought of as a way to get rid of demons or devils (if they
        exist) that may be “possessing” a person. If you haven’t noticed, possessing demons are fairly rare these days
        (although some fundamentalist Christian sects blame everything from smoking and gambling to poverty and cancer
        on demons). Yet, in medieval literature they seemed to be fairly common. We must ask ourselves, “What happened
        to them?” The conclusion must be that either they have almost totally ceased to bother people, they never
        existed, or the modern interpretation of these “demons” is different. Well, there is no reason to believe that
        the demons said to possess people in the Middle Ages have changed, and with all the reports of exorcisms during
        that period, there is little reason to assume that all those reports were faulty. Therefore, we may assume that
        the “demons” are being handled in a different manner. If you look at the actual reports of the exorcisms from
        that time you must be struck by the similarity between the descriptions of the “possessed” and people who today
        would be described as having certain physical or mental problems. So, even if we are to assume that some
        exorcisms did deal with demon possession, it seems that many functioned as a sort of early psychotherapy in the
        tradition of what is today known as “psychodrama.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">These techniques are not associated only with medieval Christian
        philosophy. Similar techniques were used in some initiatic systems. But for our purposes here, the most
        important thing to know is that in many cases the exorcisms worked.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The Golden Dawn system of telesmatic images is based on a complex
        technique of visualizations according to a pre-established code of image construction. The members of the order
        would find an entity and build up its appearance for visualization using a complex set of rules. It is too
        involved to discuss in its full form here. The idea, however, is to create an image of something which in itself
        is devoid of form. Thus, “justice” could be made to have a specific image. So could “freedom” become a
        particular angel or archangel. “Intolerance” could be visualized as a demon with a set of features determined by
        the telesmatic system. Then, once this image was created, it could be given a “life” of its own (to a limited
        extent). Finally, it could be dealt with as if it were a living, breathing entity like you or me.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Notice that I said that something like “intolerance” could be given
        form. Likewise, any quality, good or bad, can be given form. It is this idea, along with the idea that exorcism
        was an early technology for dealing with unwanted psychological issues, that is the basis of the I.O.B.
        technique.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">A word of warning:</span> It may be that going to
        a positive, growth-oriented psychotherapist who is not against occult studies may be better for you than
        attempting the I.O.B. technique to deal with your “inner demons.” This is because the I.O.B. technique is the
        only thing in this entire course that could be considered dangerous. By this I do not mean that demons might
        attack you or you might get ill. What I mean is that through this technique you will learn more about your true
        nature than you may be able to accept. It is said that over the doors of the ancient mystery schools was seen
        the phrase “Know Thyself.” Really knowing yourself can be the most awe-inspiring and frightening experience
        imaginable. So, if you opt to attempt this technique and find yourself scared, physically ill or feeling lost,
        <span class="italic">stop immediately!</span> The mind has certain blocks and safeguards, which prevent us from
        learning the innermost truths about ourselves until we are ready to accept them. Go slow, be gentle, and if you
        try this system be kind to yourself. It is very powerful.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">The “I” in I.O.B. stands for
            “Identify.”</span></span> Your first and perhaps most challenging task in this technique is to identify
        aspects of yourself that you no longer wish to possess. Are you hard-headed? Egotistical? Self-centered?
        Insecure? Indecisive? Whatever it is, your first task is to identify it. Now, at the beginning this is quite
        safe, although it might not be too easy to admit to those things which you consider to be your own faults.
        Later, it will become easier to admit your faults on a conscious level, but your unconscious may resist your
        conscious. This will be the time to go easy. Never force something if it will not come easily. Work on one thing
        at a time. This process may be time-consuming, but it is far shorter and cheaper than Freudian analysis (Freud
        actually wrote that he wanted his system to take a long time and cost patients a lot of money). And it does
        work.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">The “O” in I.O.B. stands for
            “Objectify.”</span></span> This second step is the easiest and most fun. The idea here is to build up an
        image that represents what you have identified. This can be any form, although it should preferably be capable
        of life. Thus, a rock would not be as good for this technique as would an elf, or a dog, or the image of a
        demon.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Let’s assume that you have determined that one of the things which you
        wish to rid yourself of is hardheadedness, the inability to change. In this step we want to objectify this
        hardheadedness, make it into a thing. We can make up any image, but for our purpose here let us give it a
        somewhat human appearance. Its face must have firmly chiseled features, and he (let’s make it male) has an army
        helmet on. His eyes are steel grey. He is tall and strong, but the joints of his legs and hips do not work, so
        his strength is useless. He is wearing a metallic jump-suit, and beneath it are seen hard muscles, which never
        relax. In fact, in some places the muscles look like nuts and bolts. Although it is hidden, it is possible to
        sense that he feels great pain because he can never relax: he must always be hard, there is a fear of not being
        right, etc. In this way an image of hardheadedness is built up. All of the things I mentioned are
        objectifications of the archetype of hardheadedness. If this happens to be an aspect of yourself that you wish
        to work on, you can start with what I have given and continue. What color is his skin and hair? (Don’t be
        limited by standard or “normal” colors.) Is he holding anything? Doing anything?</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Lastly, name this creation. You can use any name as long as it is not
        the name of someone you know or know of. Again, it does not have to be standard. “I-gis” (hard “g”) is short and
        applicable. “Grelflexor” is an interesting and perfectly acceptable appellation.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Spend some time making this image as concrete as possible in your
        mind. You may wish to draw it if you have some artistic abilities. Also, it does not have to be in human form.
        It can be shaped like a bizarre animal. In fact, that might even be better.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Once you have “created” this image, the next step is to give it life.
        Visualize the figure and do the LBRP around both you and the figure. If you have made a painting or sculpture or
        decoupage of the image, use that as a focus of the LBRP. Use your mind and visualization abilities to make the
        physical art creation and the mental image unite.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Next, do the Middle Pillar technique. When you sense the energy in the
        Middle Pillar is at a peak, take a deep breath and, with a full exhalation, send the life-giving (literally)
        energy down your arms and out your hands toward the figure that you have mentally created. If you have a
        physical representation of the image, send it toward that figure.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">The “B” in I.O.B. stands for
            “Banish.”</span></span> This is the magickal equivalent of exorcism. However, this process of
        banishment&mdash;though based on the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram&mdash;is a little tricky because
        we are banishing an unwanted part of ourselves. Now, let’s go through this step by step.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP ONE</span>. Purify the outside of yourself
        with a ritual bath as already described.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP TWO</span>. Do the Relaxation Ritual.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP THREE</span>. If you have a picture or
        sculpture of your objectification, look at it for a few minutes. Then put the physical image away and work it up
        in your imagination. If you have no physical image, simply build it up in your imagination. Make it as real as
        you possibly can.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP FOUR</span>. As part of your visualization
        you should see a wispy cord or rope-like construction connecting you and the figure. It should be connected to
        both your body and the body of your objectification at the solar plexus. If it does not have a solar plexus,
        then it should be attached to its heart area or head.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">(Remember, your visualization needs to be only as good as you can make
        it. It does not have to be perfect. In fact, if you are not good at visualizing things, simply know&mdash;not
        think or believe, but <span class="italic">know</span>&mdash;that it is there and that if your psychic vision
        were better you would be able to see it.)</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP FIVE</span>. Now, take your dagger and make
        a physical motion that cuts the connecting cord close to your body. If you do not have a dagger, use two fingers
        of your right hand as if they were a pair of scissors. The important thing to remember about this step is that
        it should be both physical (you should do an action) and mental (you should visualize the cutting of the
        cord).</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP SIX</span>. Immediately, and without so much
        as a nanosecond’s pause after Step Five, make the sign of the enterer (take a step forward with your left foot
        as you thrust your arms forward, dagger or right forefinger along with the left forefinger pointing straight
        ahead) directly at the newly separated figure. At the same time, project a bright blue pentagram at the figure
        from your fingers and shout, “[Name of the object], be gone!” This should cause the visualization to move a
        short distance away and stay there long enough for you to perform . . .</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP SEVEN</span>. The LBRP. Perform the complete
        Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram. When this is completed, make sure the figure you created is <span
          class="italic">outside</span> of your protective circle. Make sure that there is no trace of the severed cord
        that existed between you and the figure. If a small, vestigial piece of it remains, that’s okay, but anything
        attached to you should be completely within your circle, while anything attached to the figure outside of your
        circle must not enter the circle at all.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19"><span class="italic">STEP EIGHT</span>. Determine which magickal tool would be the
        appropriate weapon to destroy the figure. Here are some possible examples:<div class="calibre20">
          <blockquote class="calibre21">
            <div class="calibre19">
              <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">For hardheadedness (unwillingness to change): <br
                    class="calibre5" />The chalice. <br class="calibre5" />For fickleness: The pentacle. <br
                    class="calibre5" />For sloth: The wand. <br class="calibre5" />For lack of clear thinking: The
                  dagger.</span></div>
            </div>
          </blockquote>
        </div>
        <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As you can see, the appropriate tool represents the opposite qualities
        of what you wish to rid yourself. Water is always changing, so the chalice is a good weapon against
        unwillingness to change. The solidity of Earth, as represented by the pentacle, is a good weapon against
        constantly changing the mind. The energy represented by the Fire wand is a good weapon against laziness, and
        since Air represents our higher faculties, Air’s tool, the dagger, is a good weapon against lack of clear
        thinking. If you do not have a set of the traditional tools, use whatever you have that represents the
        appropriate element.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP NINE</span>. Point the appropriate magickal
        weapon at the figure (be sure to drink the contents of the chalice if it is filled <span
          class="italic">before</span> doing this!). The instructions for how to point the pentacle are to simply hold
        it by the black sections and face the concave side in the direction you wish to point. Pointing the wand and
        dagger are obvious. Hold the chalice by its stem or base with the section for holding fluid facing out, away
        from you. If you do not have the tools as yet, just use the outward-facing palms of your hands. Say:</span>

    </div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP TEN</span>. Do the Middle Pillar Ritual very
        briefly. Then, as in the Circulation of the Body of Light, feel the energy come down from above, but this time
        direct it down your arms and out your hands, through the appropriate magickal tool (if you have it), through the
        center of the pentagram in front of you from the LBRP (it must not go anywhere else), and into your creation.
        Visualize the energy getting stronger and the figure getting weaker and increasingly transparent. With each
        exhalation, the energy leaving you should be stronger and stronger until the created figure is totally
        overpowered and vanishes into nothingness. Continue this sending of energy, in the name of Divinity, for at
        least a minute after the figure is totally destroyed.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP ELEVEN</span>. Now hold your arms up in the

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP TWELVE</span>. Once again, do the LBRP.
        Then, visualize your magickal circle fading from your attention, but know that it is still there. Write down the
        results in your diary.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The I.O.B. technique can help you solve many of your problems. But
        remember, at this time you are just a magician in training. A chef learning to cook does not always have his or
        her food come out perfectly, and your I.O.B. technique may not be perfect at first either. You may need to
        repeat this technique several times in order to rid yourself of some aspect of your being or behavior you do not
        want. If you have created (or purchased) an artistic version of your visualization, it should be totally
        destroyed after doing the I.O.B. And if the problem is not succumbing to your work, go on to another aspect of
        your personality you wish to change or eliminate and come back to the previous problem later.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If you, and the other members of your group, practice the I.O.B.
        technique regularly, it is possible that your group will work harmoniously together. And if you want to work
        alone, your own work on the I.O.B. technique will make you a better person.</span></div>

                Too</span></span></div>
          <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
          <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">While I have received numerous letters of success from people
              using the I.O.B. technique, I’ve also received messages from people who have only had temporary success. I
              had used the technique for making personal change and other forms of magickal work with great success, and
              frankly I didn’t understand why some people were having problems.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Although I had occastionally studied hypnosis on my own for a
              long time, there had been no structure to my studies. It was only in late 1999 that I took my first
              professional class in hypnosis and hypnotherapy. It was there that I found the solution to the
              problem.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There is an old saying, originated as a scientific concept by
              Aristotle, and known as <span class="italic">horror vacui</span>, that “nature abhors a vacuum.” By this
              he meant that an empty space would always try to suck in a liquid or gas.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In that basic hypnosis class, the instructor pointed out that
              helping people stop smoking was the “bread and butter” for many hypnotists. Often, however, people who try
              and use hypnosis to stop smoking make an error that leads to failure. The process of smoking includes
              activities and takes time. You have to get your cigarettes, take one out of the pack, put it in your
              mouth, find a lighter or match to start it, take the time to smoke it, find a place to put it out, find a
              place for the butt, and put the cigarettes and lighter or match away. If you simply use hypnosis to help a
              person stop smoking, he or she is left with a blank spot, an emptiness, and a bunch of unused time.
              Something will fill up that time and replace the activity. If you don’t give a person something to do
              during that time, the person will do so by themselves. And the easiest thing to do is fall back into old
              patterns and start smoking again.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">So in professional hypnotherapy to stop smoking, the hypnotist
              works with a client before the hypnosis begins to figure out something to fill up that time with one or
              more activities.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This led me to a great “aha!” moment. If you get rid of
              something in the I.O.B. and don’t replace it with something, the demon you banished could return and fill
              up the vacuum you created.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The solution, then, is to come up with replacement activities.
              If, for example, you’re working on hardheadedness, come up with simple activities&mdash;perhaps just
              reading about other people’s beliefs with an open mind&mdash;to replace what you banished.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Yes, nature does abhor a vacuum, even if that vacuum is in your
              mind. It will fill it with something. Choose for yourself what you want to fill the vacuum with before
              nature (or your unconscious, that little devil!) does it for you, and establish it as a habit through
              repetition.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Occult groups usually have various levels known as degrees or grades.
        They follow a certain logical pattern, such as going up the Tree of Life or simply making sure that you
        understand the increasing information needed to achieve the group’s highest level. The Hermetic Order of the
        Golden Dawn did an interesting thing. After you finished the basic introductory grade of Neophyte, identified as
        the 0=0 degree, you would go through a combination pattern. The next four degrees were linked to the first
        through fourth Sephiroht of the Tree of Life and to the magickal elements.</span></div>

        <span class="bold1">The Air Element</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In this book we will be focusing on linking ourselves to understanding
        and working with the elements. In the previous lesson, we worked with Earth. In this lesson, aligned with the
        initiatic pattern of the Golden Dawn and other Western groups, we move on to the study of the magickal element
        of Air. As a reminder, go back and make sure that you’ve mastered the techniques in the previous lesson. In
        fact, look over all of the things you have learned since you started working with this book. When finished, you
        should start with the exercises below as soon as possible. If, after working the exercises for Earth in the
        previous lesson you are not satisfied with your understanding of and feelings of unity with the element Earth,
        continue with those exercises for up to two more weeks. Then do them sporadically as you will. However, you
        should begin the exercises below immediately.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">The element of Air has the qualities of being
          warm and moist</span>. The following exercises will help you to become more aware of this element in your
        daily life.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Exercise 1</span>. Observe those things around
        you that have the combined qualities of warmth and moistness. Remember, all of these elemental qualities are
        relative. Steam is a form of the element Air, and it has much more moisture and warmth than does the vapor from
        dry ice. However, the cold vapor from the dry ice also has the element of Air within it. See if you can
        determine the relative Airy qualities as you experience them. Make a list of all these things and record it in
        your magickal diary. Do this exercise daily for one week.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Exercise 2.</span> Find a spot where you can be
        out-of-doors and alone. Take with you an outdoor reclining lounger, the type that has nylon webbing spaced
        around an aluminum frame. If you don’t have one of these, a folding chair will suffice. The idea here is to be
        elevated above the ground and have as much of the physical air surrounding your body as possible.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Remove all of your clothing and lie on the lounger or sit in the
        chair. If you cannot find a place where this is possible, wear as little clothing as you can. For men, a brief
        men’s swimming suit is fine, and for women a tiny bikini will do. The object here is not nudity, but rather to
        allow as much air to touch your body as possible.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">What you will be doing is known as “elemental pore breathing.” To do
        this, start off by doing the Relaxation Ritual. Next, become very aware of your breath. Become aware of the slow
        in-and-out motion of the physical air. Notice the way the air feels as it comes in through the nose, goes down
        the air pipe, and into the lungs. Sense, visualize, or just imagine the interchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide
        within the lungs, and feel the CO<sub class="calibre34">2</sub>-laden air as it goes out of the lungs, through
        the air pipe, and out the nose and mouth.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Now imagine that your entire body is nothing but a large breathing
        apparatus. Imagine that every part of your body only has the function of breathing. Further, visualize or
        imagine that your skin is part of this system. As you physically breathe, imagine that <span
          class="italic">every pore</span> of your skin is also breathing. However, just as your lungs breathe in
        physical air, your pores should be breathing in elemental Air. Feel it going in and out of you, cleansing,
        purifying, and vitalizing your entire body.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Try this exercise at different times of the day and, if possible, at
        different locations. Air is the second most changeable of the elements and you can experience it in many
        different ways. Do this exercise daily for at least a week. If you wish, you may do it for a longer period of
        time&mdash;it’s a really fun exercise and you’re going to enjoy it&mdash;but after a week go on to the next
        exercise.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Exercise 3</span>. Spend a period of up to three
        minutes (no more), once a day, imagining that <span class="italic">you are the element Air</span>. Feel the
        lightness, the floating giddiness, the warmth and moistness of Air. Feel how physical things don’t seem to
        matter and learn the true meaning of the term “airhead” while understanding that it is merely a description and
        not a negative comment. This is not said in jest, but in all seriousness. Become Air.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Do this exercise for a week only, no more. Do not repeat it (if
        repeating it is your desire) for at least a month. Do not repeat it more often than one week out of a month.
        That is, no more than twelve weeks per year, one week at a time. If you notice that you are having trouble
        finishing your normal work, <span class="italic">halt this exercise immediately</span>. In a day or two you will
        be back to normal. Also, doing Exercise 3 from the section on the element of Earth from the previous lesson will
        help overcome the problem of absorbing too much Air, which is the cause of becoming an “airhead” in the negative
        sense.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Exercise 4</span>. Once you have learned how to
        “be Air” (without allowing it to take over your life), the next step is to take greater conscious control of the
        element. Take a moment and imagine yourself to be Air. Bring the feeling from the last exercise into your
        consciousness. Next, hold your hands nine to twelve inches apart, palms facing each other. Visualize or just
        imagine a bottle or box between your hands. Now, as you exhale, visualize all of the Air element that is in you
        going out with your breath and being trapped in the container between your hands. Three to five breaths should
        be enough to fill it. Then, with three breaths, inhale it back into yourself and go back to normal
        consciousness.</span></div>

                Magick</span> is not just a bunch of lessons to read. Well, I suppose you could do that if you wanted

              purpose of this course is to help you <span class="italic">become a powerful magician</span>.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Many of the techniques given here need to be memorized so that
              you can forget about the technique and throw yourself into the practice. In other words, the practice
              needs to become a habit.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In 1960, Dr. Maxwell Maltz published <span
                class="italic">Psycho-Cybernetics: A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life</span>. Maltz was a plastic
              surgeon who observed an interesting phenomenon. He saw that it took about twenty-one days after an
              amputation for a patient to develop the “phantom limb” sensation, a feeling that there was still a limb
              where the amputation had been and that it was hurting, aching, itching, etc. He derived from this that it
              took three weeks (twenty-one days) to install a new habit.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The thinking behind this is that to install a habit we have to
              bombard our brains for this length of time&mdash;without an interruption&mdash;to produce the new
              connections and energy/information flows within the brain that will break an old habit and/or establish a
              new habit. If there is an interruption, you have to begin the twenty-one-day period of repetition
              again.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I do not know if this is exactly what happens for one main
              reason. Although I believe that the brain (the grey stuff between the ears) is linked to the mind, I’m not
              sure they are the same. If they are not, then changing the brain may or may not change the mind. For
              evidence to support this, scientists have mapped out the brain, and although a section of the brain
              attributed to a certain behavior may be damaged, the person can still either perform or redevelop that
              behavior.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If we assume that the brain is not the mind, is there any
              evidence that it takes twenty-one days for the mind to develop a habit? Maltz discovered that if he worked
              with patients wanting plastic surgery, giving them positive visualizations to focus upon for three weeks,
              it would alter the patients’ mindset and many would go so far as to cancel the surgery.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This may have been achieved simply because Maltz wanted it to
              happen so his patients complied (one aspect that leads to success with hypnotherapy). Whatever the cause,
              this three-week rule has become a standard theory in behavior-changing work.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I figured I could give you a week to get the basics of any
              lesson going, and three weeks to practice, turning rituals and techniques into habits. During that time, I
              hope you will also further your study of the materials in the lesson. So yes, you “gotta.”</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">By the way, Maltz’s books are based on visualization techniques,
              and I’ll be covering some secret methods for that in these lessons. In the meantime, you may want to look
              at Dr. Maltz’s books.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">The Test.</span> This test will allow you to see
        whether or not you really have become in harmony with the magickal element of Air. It will also allow you to
        objectively judge whether you are actually able to control the element.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The next time you feel heavy, bloated, slow, or lazy, form the
        container of Air as described in the previous exercise. Once the container of Air has been formed, with one big
        inhalation draw the contents of the container back into you. Within five minutes you should feel relaxed and
        refreshed, lighter, and anxious to do those tasks you wish to do.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The next time that you feel lightheaded, giddy, overly silly,
        unstable, etc., again form the container of Air. Next, visualize a large “black hole” in the physical air in
        front of you. When your container is filled to overflowing with your excess elemental Air, “throw” the container
        into the black hole. That is, visualize yourself tossing the container of elemental Air into the black hole, and
        then see the hole sealing itself up after your container has entered it. You should feel more grounded and
        balanced in a few minutes. It may be necessary to repeat this “black hole” experiment two or three times to feel
        totally normal.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">When you have passed both parts of this test to your satisfaction, you
        will have mastered the element of Air. As I said about elemental Earth, if you do not succeed at such mastery
        within a few days or weeks<span class="italic">, don’t worry about it</span>. Just keep practicing. With one or
        more of the magickal elements it may take only a few hours or days to master. Other elements may take
        considerably longer. But remember, there is no race to succeed. Do not give up! Just keep practicing without
        worrying about the results. Eventually <span class="italic">you will succeed</span>, as have all who have
        diligently practiced. Don’t forget to record the results of your experiments&mdash;good, bad, or
        indifferent&mdash;in your magickal diary every day.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">As I said before, anyone can do a ritual, but a ceremony really takes
        a group to perform properly. Let’s assume that you have gathered a group of people together, and all of you are
        studying via this course. Here, then, is a practical and valuable group ritual you can perform together.</span>
    </div>
    <h2 class="calibre29"><span class="calibre30">
        <span class="bold1">A Healing Ceremony</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">This is a ceremony to help someone who needs to be healed. There
        should be a minimum of three people, plus the person to be healed. This particular ceremony should not be used
        on someone who has a fever. Nor should it be used on someone who has a minor cold or flu, as those “dis-eases”
        are needed to cleanse the body of toxins due to the poor living habits that made the person susceptible to the
        germs that are always around us. However, when most of the cold or flu is over and the ill person is just very
        tired from the effects of this illness, this ceremony is effective. It is also good for chronic diseases. The
        only exception to the above rules is if the cold or flu is life threatening.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This ceremony will not replace the treatment of a regular physician,
        an M.D., nor should you reverse a doctor’s instructions. But after this ceremony a doctor may need to change a
        treatment when a patient is found to be better or totally healed.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP ONE</span>. Have the person in your group
        who is most adept at doing a divination (such as with the Tarot) perform one to see if it is appropriate to do
        the healing. If not, follow that advice. Trust the divination.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19"><span class="italic">STEP TWO</span>. If the answer from the divination is positive, ask
        the ill person if he or she freely gives permission for the group to do this healing ceremony. If the answer is
        no, do not go further. Even if the person has previously begged for a healing, the question should still be
        asked. If the answer is positive, prepare the area as follows: <div class="calibre24">

                especially if that person is not part of your practicing group. Others should sit in the circle of
                chairs where they will See diagram on the next page.</span></blockquote>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP THREE</span>. A person should be chosen to
        lead the relaxation ritual. Let that person use a low, deep, relaxing voice, almost as if trying to coax a small
        child to fall asleep.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP FOUR</span>. Let one person do the LBRP. The
        Kabalistic Cross should be done from behind the altar, facing east. The formulation of the pentagrams should be
        done by walking <span class="italic">outside</span> the circle of chairs so that all are enclosed. The Evocation
        of the Archangels and the repetition of the Kabalistic Cross should be done facing east, from “behind” the
        altar. That is, you should be west of the altar facing toward the east. If you do not have an altar, perform
        this from behind the person who is to be healed.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It is also possible to have one person do the Kabalistic Cross,
        another do the formulation of the pentagrams, another do the Evocation of the Archangels, and the first person
        repeat the Kabalistic Cross. Personally, I have not found this to be as effective as having one person do the
        entire LBRP, but try both ways and see which you prefer. The person being healed should not be actively involved
        in the performance of the LBRP.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">All of the members of the circle who are sitting in their chairs
        should be focusing intensely on the ritual being performed. They should add their own visualizations to those of
        the person(s) doing the ritual. No one, save the person to be healed, should ever be doing nothing within the
        circle once the ceremony starts.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP FIVE</span>. Let all the ritualists, save
        one predetermined ritualist, come forward and form a tight circle, holding hands, around the person to be
        healed. In this position, let all do the Middle Pillar Ritual. The one remaining ritualist should stand in the
        east, facing west (toward the people), also doing the Middle Pillar Ritual, but should imagine himself or
        herself as being a hundred feet tall, and both watching and partaking of this ritual.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19"><span class="italic">STEP SIX</span>. The person in the east should hold in his or her
        right hand either a dagger (for chronic or mild problems) or the wand (for more severe problems). When the
        Middle Pillar Ritual is complete, this person should hold up his or her arms as if in blessing, and walk
        directly toward the circle of participants, saying:<div class="calibre20">

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">At this instant, all in the circle should imagine a giant, bright
        light above the center of the circle. This is a group Keter rather than an individual Keter. Each ritualist
        should see a beam of light shoot out from the group Keter toward the person with the tool, sending vast amounts
        of pure, healing energy. When the lone ritualist feels this has been accomplished, he or she should direct this
        huge amount of combined group and spiritual energy down to the tool and into the body of the person being
        healed.</span></div>

        very low pitch) the vowel sound “AH.” All, save the person being healed, should join in with the intonation of
        the vowel, letting it rise in pitch and volume. When the ritualist feels it can get no higher, he or she should
        say “now” as a cue for all the ritualists to shout “GLAH” (thus making AH-GLAH or AGLA as in the LBRP) and clap
        their hands loudly, thus breaking the circle of energy. This keeps the energy within the person being healed and
        prevents it from flowing back into the ceremonialists. Immediately, the main ritualist turns east, raises both
        hands (still holding the tool in the right hand), and says,<div class="calibre20">

        would not hurt them, since it is positive, it would lower the power and intensity of the healing. It also
        prevents a “negative backlash,” which is frequently suffered by healers who are naturally talented but have no
        magickal experience, knowledge, or training. Sometimes this type of healer ends up temporarily suffering from
        the same symptoms as the person being healed. This negative backlash is totally avoided by the techniques of the

    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">In this section I will be sharing some ideas on symbolism with you,
        starting with one of the oldest and best-known symbols, the cross. The cross is far older than Christianity. It
        has always been revered as a spiritual and religious symbol. This is why early Christians usurped the cross as
        “their” symbol. Various non-Christian traditions had used forms of the cross far back into antiquity. By using
        the cross as their new symbol it was thought that it would be easier to convince the Pagans that they should
        worship a similar God, one who had the same symbol. In a similar fashion, Pagan holy places were usurped by
        Christians and changed into churches. Thus, if a Pagan wished to worship at a sacred site, he or she would have
        to go into the church and worship there.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The earliest Christians used the symbol of a fish drawn with one
        continuous line (see figure below) to represent their faith. Some Christians say that this is because Jesus was
        said to be a fisherman, although nowhere in the New Testament does it mention him fishing.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Also, it is said to represent Christianity because the Greek word for
        fish, <span class="italic">icthys</span>, is an acronym (or Notarikon!) for the Greek words meaning “Jesus
        Christ, the son of God, the Savior.” On an astrological basis, Jesus wasn’t a fisherman, but a <span
          class="italic">fish man</span>; that is, an archetype of the Piscean Age. There are many dates given for the
        beginning of the Age of Pisces (the astrological sign is represented by two fish), but they all center around
        the start of the common era, within a few hundred years of the year 1 C.E.</span></div>

          <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Some readers may question my claims about the mythic aspects of
              Christianity. That’s good! Dion Fortune said there is no room for authority in occultism. I say, “Don’t
              take my word for it. Check it out yourself.”</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The concept of Christianity is firmly based on the astrological
              concepts of the Piscean age. As such, <span class="italic">in its creation</span>, it is “old age” as
              opposed to the coming new age, the age of Aquarius. The symbol of Pisces shows two fish going in opposite
              directions. Thus, we have people preaching peace while planning and practicing warfare. We have societies
              split in two. We have people extolling competition rather than cooperation. When we finally fully enter
              the next age this will change, but as the song says, we are only at the “dawning” of the age of
              Aquarius.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In the previous paragraph I didn’t mean to imply that the church
              fathers sat around in a circle planning a religion to fit the characteristics of the Piscean age. Rather,
              they were so heavily influenced by the energies of the new Piscean age that they couldn’t help but create
              a Piscean-oriented religion with a focus on fish and fishing. To survive in the coming age Christianity
              (and all other religions) will have to evolve. But that will be up to the members of each religion.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As shown in the main body of the text of this lesson, the
              earliest symbol for Christianity was that of a fish drawn with a single line. One of Jesus’ famous
              miracles is that of the loaves and fishes. He uses metaphors related to fishing. About the only thing they
              don’t do is worship Dagon, the ancient Semitic god who, according to Jewish tradition (which the early
              Christians knew), was in the form of a fish.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">According to Austen Layard, who excavated Babylon in the
              nineteenth century, the high priest of Dagon would put on a garment made of a giant fish with the head of
              the fish forming a miter at the head of the priest. According to Alexander Hislop in his 1858 book <span
                class="italic">The Two Babylons</span>, “The two-horned mitre, which the Pope wears, when he sits on the
              high altar at Rome and receives the adoration of the Cardinals, is the very mitre worn by the priests of
              Dagon, the fish-god of the Philistines and Babylonians.”</span></div>

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Great charismatic leaders with large followings of sometimes mindless
        devotees are typical of the Piscean Age. Thus, from the dawning of this age we have had Alexander the Great,
        Jesus, Cromwell, some of the popes, Arthur of England, Mussolini, Hitler, Roosevelt, Kennedy, Marx, Stalin, Mao,
        Falwell, Rev. Moon, Jim Jones, Prabhupada, Gandhi, and many others. I am not trying to equate the qualities of
        goodness or badness between these men, only to indicate their charisma and ability to attract an utterly
        devoted, sometimes mindless following. Nor should I have left out the women, such as Joan of Arc, Blavatsky,
        Besant, McPherson, Anthony, Sanger, Peron, and others. These women, too, attracted and still attract many
        followers. Jesus, as a Piscean Age archetype, is perfectly represented by the symbol of the fish.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">One of the earliest forms of the cross was known in ancient Egypt. It
        had a loop at the top and was (and still is) known as the Crux Ansata, the looped cross, Isis’ sandal strap, and
        most commonly as the ankh. Many people following a spiritual path try to ignore the inherent sexuality of the
        ankh. The vertical bar represents the erect male organ while the loop and the split horizontal bar represent the
        female sexual organ. Together, indicating sexual intercourse, they are a symbol of fertility. With this
        understanding it is easy to see how the ankh has evolved into a symbol of life, eternal life, reincarnation, and
        rebirth. Why would the Isis’ sandal strap represent eternal life, as some have claimed?</span></div>

    <div class="calibre13">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Why, as one group maintains, would the shadow of a person with his or
        her arms outstretched (which looks like an ankh) represent life after life? This cross is a pre-Christian and
        non-Christian symbol. Curiously, the ankh is used by Roman Catholics. On their robes (specifically, part of
        certain forms of the chasuble or possibly a type of rationale worn over the chasuble), some church officials
        wear two ankhs, one on the front and one on the back, with a common loop. When wearing this outfit, the loop is
        placed over the head, which gives rise to speculation over sexual symbolism and spirituality. In any event, the
        looped cross is not a Christian symbol.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The ancient Pagan Europeans also had crosses. One type of cross which
        was popular was the equal-armed, or solar, cross. Another was the circled or Celtic cross. (Remember, “Celtic”
        is pronounced “kel-tik” and not “sel-tik.” The cross and the people are pronounced “kel-tik.” The basketball
        team is pronounced “sel-tik.”)</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Another form of the cross that appeared all over Europe, Asia, and
        both North America and South America was the spinning solar cross, also known as the fylfot (“fill-foh”) cross,
        the hammer of Thor,or the swastika. This holy and mystical symbol was most often drawn in a horizontal-vertical
        pattern with the arms in such a way that the cross appeared to be moving either with the Sun, clockwise, or
        against the Sun, counterclockwise. It is a shame that this symbol was perverted by Adolf Hitler himself, who
        chose the full design of the Nazi flag.</span></div>

        <div class="calibre14"></div> In the diagram you can see how the Nazi swastika goes against the Sun, giving the
        impression of spinning in a counter-clockwise direction. Note, too, that it is on a point rather than
        horizontal-vertical. Although the Nazis did at times use the true mystical swastika, their official symbol was
        the perverted version. Today, most people in the West are disgusted with the symbol because it represented the
        horrors brought upon the world by the Nazis. In places such as India, however, in its standard form it is still
        honored as a sacred symbol and a good-luck charm.

        to firmly implant in your mind that the rituals we do, even though in places they do involve the symbolism of
        the cross, are not Christian, Nazi, or any other faith or dogma. Nor are they merely de-Christianized versions
        of Christian symbols and rituals. If anything, it would be more correct to say that Christianity has borrowed
        the ancient mystical symbols for its own purposes. Thus, if you are Jewish, Hindu, Moslem, Pagan, agnostic, or
        something else, there should be nothing to hinder you from using the holy symbol of the cross as in the famous
        Celtic Cross Tarot reading, the Kabalistic Cross section of the LBRP, and in other rituals as well. The way we
        use a cross is not Christian, or perhaps I could say that it is “beyond Christian.” Also, symbols currently used
        by other traditions can be used by those from Christian backgrounds without insult, as they come from our
        universal mystical source, not a sectarian one.</span></div>

          <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">It was a strange convergence that led Hitler to choose the
              swastika as a symbol of the Nazi party. It began when linguists began to notice that the ancient language
              of India, Sanskrit, had many similarities with Western languages. How could this be possible if there was
              not communication between India and the West in ancient times?</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">One linguist, Max Müller (1823-1900), hit upon an answer. He
              came up with a theory that India had been inhabited by a dark-skinned race (known as Dravidians and who,
              this theory holds, were ignorant savages) and that around 1500 B.C.E. they were invaded by a race of
              light-skinned “Indo-European” people from northwestern Asia (known as Aryans), who were highly advanced
              and brought language and civilization. He chose that date because he believed in the theory held by some
              Christians that the world was created by God in 4004 B.C.E., so this invasion couldn’t have happened
              earlier.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This theory was picked up by German occult groups and
              nationalists who hated the idea that Western culture came from the Semites (i.e., Jews) of the Middle
              East. It also, regrettably, was picked up by other occult groups, including the important Theosophical
              society and its major voice, Madame Blavatsky. Hitler, wanting to link the Nazis with the superior,
              light-skinned culture, took a symbol of this supposed “Aryan race” and changed it to fit his needs.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There is one major problem with Müller’s theory. There is not
              one bit of proof to support it. The supposedly civilized Aryan people who brought Sanskrit to the
              Dravidians left no written record, while the “ignorant” people of India produced some of the most amazing,
              spiritual, and elaborate writings going back many thousands of years. There is no physical evidence for
              such an invasion. There is no DNA to support this migratory theory. In fact, the word “Aryan” simply means
              “a noble or honorable person.” It was used as a term to describe spiritual leaders and had nothing to do
              with “races.”</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Sadly, the British promoted this Aryan invasion theory in India.
              After all, presenting a racist concept of a superior light-skinned race bringing civilization to the
              “ignorant” and “uncivilized” people of India mirrored their own domination of the subcontinent and helped
              their empire control the Indian people.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Even today, with increasing proof that there is no “Aryan race”
              and there never was an Aryan invasion of India, some people&mdash;even people in India&mdash;desperately
              hold on to their belief in the reality of this racist and anti-Semitic myth born out of hatred and silly
              fundamentalist Christian beliefs as to the time of the birth of the universe.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Another symbol is composed of the letters “INRI.” The most famous use
        of these letters was supposedly on Jesus’ cross. They were an abbreviation (again a Notarikon; there are many of
        these in both the Christian and Jewish versions of the Bible) for “Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews.”</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">During the Dark Ages and into the Renaissance, if you did not want to
        be tortured and burned by the powers of the church, it was a wise idea to hide mystical and political ideas
        within Christian symbolism. Thus, other meanings of the letters INRI developed. To alchemists, it stood for
        <span class="italic">Igne Naturae Renovatur Integra</span>, Latin for “Nature by Fire is renewed in its
        integrity.” In a later lesson I will be discussing certain aspects of alchemy that will make this particular
        phrase instantly clear and of great magickal import.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Another version of these letters that was also important to the
        medieval alchemists was <span class="italic">Igne Nitrum Raris Invenitum</span>. Again, this was Latin, then the
        language of the learned, and meant “shining (or glittering) is rarely found in Fire.” This may be a bit more
        difficult to comprehend, but once a certain aspect of alchemy is explained, it should become very clear.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Believe it or not, there are many people today who consider the Jesuit
        Order to be a danger to our way of life. Personally, I don’t agree with that thought, even if they do follow a
        leader known as the “Black Pope.” He is called this not for spiritual blackness, but because black is the color
        of his robes. Also, I am not personally a believer in conspiracy theories of world domination. However, the
        Jesuits did go through a very political period, much as some clerics of different faiths express their political
        views today. When the Jesuits went through that political period, INRI to them stood for <span
          class="italic">lusticum</span> [or <span class="italic">Justicum</span>] <span class="italic">Necare Regis
          Impium</span>, which is Latin for “It is just to kill an impious king.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">Kabalistically, the letters INRI represent much more. INRI, which in Hebrew would be Yud,
        Nun, Resh, and Yud, are also the first letters in Hebrew for the four archetypal elements (according to J. S. M.

      <div class="calibre19">According to the ancient Kabalistic document the <span class="italic">Sepher

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There have been many “savior gods” in the history of our planet. For
        the Norse it was Baldur. For the Egyptians it was Osiris. For the ancient Celts of the British Isles it was
        Lugh. To the Hindus it was (and is) Krishna. Just as in the Christian story of the “only” son of God, all of
        these “savior gods” died and came back to life for the good of humanity. All of these resurrection gods are
        associated with the Sun. They “die” in winter and are reborn with the warmth and plant and animal life which
        reappears in the spring. Unfortunately, the topic of savior-resurrection gods is far too extensive to cover in
        depth here. If this topic interests you, see the books listed in the bibliography.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If we were to use the Egyptian pantheon of gods, Virgo is represented
        by the goddess Isis, she who is nature and the mother of all things. Scorpio is represented by Apophis (also
        known as Set or Typhon), who was death, the destroyer. Sol is represented by Osiris, who, slain and risen, was
        the Egyptian resurrection and vegetative deity. Since the “I” in the “INRI” formula is repeated and represents
        two of the magickal elements, the three members of the Egyptian pantheon (Isis, Apophis, and Osiris) can
        represent the four archetypal elements of which everything on Earth is composed. They can also represent famous
        thoughts of alchemy, and, if you desire, they can represent some of the basic, albeit “borrowed,” ideas used by
        Christianity.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It is interesting to note that the Notarikon, the abbreviation made of
        the first letters of Isis, Apophis, and Osiris, “IAO” (pronounced “eeeee-aaaaahhoooohhh”) forms the name of the
        supreme God of the Gnostics, an early sect of Christianity.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Resurrection or redeemer gods are always associated with Sol, the Sun.
        The Sun is the primary giver of light to our planet. It follows, therefore, that light is always associated with
        the idea of a redeemer god. This is why beneficial or “white” occult groups always try to bring light (spiritual
        light) to humanity.</span></div>

          <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
          <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">I have always been fascinated by etymology, the study of where
              words came from and how they developed. The word “impious,” of course, is the antonym or opposite of
              “pious.” In the <span class="italic">Tanach,</span> or Jewish version of the Bible, the Hebrew men are
              told not to trim or cut their sideburns. Today still, orthodox Jewish men can be seen with long sideburns.
              Sometimes they are even braided. It is considered a sign of holiness or piety. In fact, that’s where the
              word “pious” comes from: “pious” is Hebrew for “sideburns.”</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The above now makes me think about the word “holy” and where it
              came from. Etymological dictionaries say its source is unknown and “probably” has to do with the concept
              of wholeness and health. To me, that seems to be a long reach and more in line with modern beliefs than
              with those of people from eons ago. I think something else makes far more sense, or at least as much as
              pious having to do with sideburns.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In ancient times, long before the births of Christianity or
              biblical Judaism, the type of religion or spiritual system followed by many people was shamanistic in
              nature. Part of many shamanistic cultures is the idea that a stone with a natural hole in it was
              considered very sacred. So, too, were other objects with natural holes, from sea shells up to the mouths
              of caves. From this comes the idea that one sign of a sacred object was its natural hole. A “holey” object
              was sacred. From this came our word “holy.”</span></div>

    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">In Latin, the word for “light” is spelled LVX and pronounced “lux,” with the “u” sounding
        like that in the word “tube.” In rituals we represent certain archetypal ideas to our psyches via poses and
        actions. It is easily possible to represent the idea of spiritual LVX or “light” by spelling it out with various
        gestures. For example:<div class="calibre2"><img alt="064" src="images/000180.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>
        <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
        <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">L</span>&mdash;Left arm straight out to the
            side, horizontally, with the palm forward. Right arm straight up, palm to the left.</span></div>
        <div class="calibre5"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></span></div>
        <div class="calibre13">&nbsp;</div>

        <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
        <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">V</span>&mdash;Both arms straight up over the
            head forming the letter “V.” The palms should be facing each other. The angle between the arms should be
            about sixty degrees.</span></div>
        <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
        <div class="calibre13">&nbsp;</div>
        <div class="calibre2"><img alt="066" src="images/000118.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>

        <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">X</span>&mdash;The arms crossed on the chest,
            right over left, head slightly bowed.</span></div>

        <div class="calibre13">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">These positions are the basis for what are known as the LVX gestures.
        By knowing the ideas represented by our mystical notion of light, we can use the gestures to aspire to the
        illumination (LVX) implied by these “gestures of the art.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Here is another interesting thing in regard to the idea of LVX. In
        Roman numerals, L = 50, V = 5, and X = 10, for a total of 65. In Hebrew the letters Aleph = 1, Dalet = 4, Nun =
        50, and Yud = 10. Together, they also total 65. These Hebrew letters spell out the word “Ah-doh-nye” (my Lord),
        one of the names of God. As you will remember, it is used in the LBRP. If spiritual light (LVX) = 65 and
        Divinity (in the “Ah-doh-nye” aspect) = 65, then according to Gematria we must assume that there is some
        relationship between the two. There is such a relationship: they are one and the same! The ultimate Divinity is
        that infinite spiritual light known in Hebrew as Ain Soph Or (meaning Limitless Light), the third veil of
        “negative existence” before God begins manifesting at Keter.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre14">
      <div class="calibre19">Before moving on to the next part of this lesson, there are still a few theoretical things
        to cover. First is the meaning of the magickal word “ARARITA” (“Ahrah-ree-tah”). It is a Notarikon, an
        abbreviation or acronym for the phrase in Hebrew, pronounced:<div class="calibre20">
          <blockquote class="calibre21">
            <div class="calibre19">

                  <br class="calibre5" /><span class="bold">Teh-mur-ah-toh Eh-chad.</span></span></div>

          </blockquote>
        </div>
        <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As always with transliterated Hebrew in this book, the “ch” in this
        phrase is pronounced like that in the Scottish word “loch.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The above phrase, represented by the Notarikon ARARITA, means “One is
        God’s beginning, one principle is God’s individuality, God’s permutation is one.” This clearly states the
        Kabalistic attitude that no matter the name by which you call Divinity, there is only one ultimate Divinity, one
        divine source which can be summoned. Everything is of Divinity, or as is said in a ritual, “There is no part of
        me which is not of the gods.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There is a short series of hexagrams which you must learn. Actually, I
        think of them more as being “paired triangles” than hexagrams. Israel Regardie, in his book <span
          class="italic">Ceremonial Magic</span>, suggests using Crowley’s unicursal hexagram instead of the traditional
        four paired triangles. I have learned it both ways and I quite prefer the traditional style. That is what will
        be given here.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Practice drawing them somewhat large in the air in front of you. They
        should be similar in size to the pentagrams of the LBRP. Take note of the direction to face when drawing these
        hexagrams. Also note the archetypal element to which each is associated.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Many people have noticed that the elements associated with the
        quarters of the circle have changed and are puzzled over this. One author went so far as to “explain” this
        change by saying it is a trap for the unwary and meant to fool people. I respectfully disagree.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The elemental associations for the LBRP are specifically related to
        the physical plane, the Earth plane, Mahl-koot. The elemental associations for the hexagrams that you’ll see on
        the next page are associated with a higher plane, specifically the level associated with the zodiac. On the
        Earth plane, most of us are familiar with the elements as Water to the west, Air to the east, Fire to the south,
        and Earth to the north. On the zodiacal level, the signs follow a natural order called the triplicities because
        it repeats three times through the zodiac. The first sign, Aries, is a Fire sign. The second sign, Taurus, is an
        Earth sign. The third sign, Gemini, is an Air sign. The fourth sign, Cancer, is a Water sign. This
        structure&mdash;Fire, Earth, Air, and Water&mdash;repeats twice more for the remaining eight signs of the
        zodiac, in order. It also forms the pattern for use with the hexagrams on this higher, zodiacal plane: east is
        Fire, south is Earth, west is Air, and north is Water. All of this changing may seem complex, but with just a
        little practice the two different systems will be mastered.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Each triangle begins at the apex (even if the triangle is inverted and
        the apex is at the bottom), and the figure is drawn counterclockwise until it returns to its point of
        origination. In the diagrams on the next page, start drawing at the point numbered 1 and move in the direction
        of the arrow until you complete the triangle. Then start at the point numbered 2 and move in the direction of
        the arrow until you complete the second triangle. Note that the hexagram of the west has a common line, however
        for clarity it is shown as two separate triangles.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Before moving on to the next part of this lesson, it is probably time
        for you to alter the way you perform the Tarot Contemplation Ritual. You should by now be using all of the Major
        Arcana cards in this ritual. When you choose a card in this advanced version, instead of merely looking at the
        card, <span class="italic"><span class="bold">imagine yourself as the main character in the card</span></span>.
        You may change the gender of the main figure of the card so that the sex of that character matches your own. If
        there is no main character, or no human character, simply put yourself into the card anywhere. Close your eyes
        and visualize yourself in the card. Imagine you are there. Once you feel that you are “in” the card, will your
        eyes to open (not your physical eyes; keep them closed). Rather, allow your astral or psychic eyes to open so
        you can really look out at the scene from the card. Take a few minutes and really look around. See everything in
        the card from the viewpoint of yourself within the card. Try to see what is behind the images of which you can
        normally see only the front. Most importantly, determine if you can see anything <span class="italic">beyond the
          edge of the card</span>. Don’t do anything, just look. Do not attempt to move or go anywhere. Just observe.
        Your observation should not be limited to vision. What do you hear? What do you feel? What do you smell? Do you
        have any sensation of taste? After a few moments of this, will your psychic eyes to close and return to normal
        consciousness. Record your experience, whether or not you experienced any unusual sights, sounds, smells,
        tastes, feelings, or sensations, in your magickal diary. Take the next seven days to read over what you have
        done so far in this lesson and practice this Advanced Tarot Contemplation Ritual. Then move on to the next

        <span class="bold1">The Air Dagger</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Earlier in this lesson I mentioned that I was going to discuss the
        difference between the wand and the dagger. Although the wand has traditionally been associated with the
        magickal element of Fire and the dagger has been associated with Air, some people, especially in recent years,
        have reversed these associations. This is largely due to those people who have been using associations from
        their training in Wicca or Witchcraft. While it is true that Witchcraft is thousands of years old, it is also
        true that much of what is today called Witchcraft is either a creation of or a reconstruction by the late Gerald
        B. Gardner and his followers.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This is not meant to belittle anybody who follows a Pagan path. In
        fact, those who follow one of the various Pagan paths in many cases seem to have regained the link between
        humanity and nature that many ceremonial magicians only talk about and secretly envy. As you may have noticed,
        one of the important areas which this course has emphasized is the attunement to the elements, something which
        has been sadly lacking in most books or courses on High Magick. Part of my goal with these lessons is to bring
        that link back to the practitioners of ritual magick.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It is clear that Gardner simplified some seemingly complex magickal
        techniques and philosophy (probably “borrowed,” with or without permission, from the ubiquitous A. Crowley).
        Then, with the help of Doreen Valiente they created the modern Craft.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It does not matter whether or not he received initiation from the New
        Forest Witches, as he claimed. Nor does it matter that many have gone far beyond his initial researches,
        training, and techniques. His importance is that he introduced many to a form of spirituality that could not be
        found elsewhere when he began his work. His contributions, thankfully, will last for many years to come.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">However, as I said, some of what Gardner did was a simplification of
        traditional magickal philosophy. One of these simplifications was the equating of the dagger with the sword.
        This is understandable, as the sword does appear to be nothing more than a long dagger. And if you had only
        learned the LBRP, you might know that Me-chai-el bears a sword and stands to the south, the direction of the
        element Fire. Water, of course, would be associated with the chalice, and Earth with the pentacle. This leaves
        the wand to the element Air. And Rah-fay-el, the archangel of that element, does hold the caduceus wand. This
        all seems so logical.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Unfortunately for the above simplification, it is not correct to
        equate the purposes of any of the several wands used by a magician. The Fire wand is not the same as the lotus
        wand, the caduceus wand, or the rainbow wand. The wands carried by the initiatic officers of occult groups have
        different purposes, too. I usually wear casual shoes during the day, but “dress shoes” if I’m going out at
        night. They look similar&mdash;they both cover my feet&mdash;but they have different purposes. Similarly, the
        different wands all have varying functions even though they have the same basic shape. So, too, is the dagger
        different in design and function than the magickal sword.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If it helps to clear things in your mind, some people like to think of
        the dagger as being the tip of a spear, which is thrown through the air.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The traditional Air dagger is a simple, double-edged blade with a
        T-shaped handle, as shown below.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Since the Air dagger should never have been used to cut living things,
        it should preferably be new. Undercoat the handle and the hilt that forms the “T,” but protect the blade from
        paint. Follow the instruction on the paint concerning the treatment of the wood and/or metal before applying one
        or more coats. Several light coats look better than one thick, gloppy coat. Then paint the undercoated parts a
        bright yellow.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">On the next page you will find a listing of the Hebrew words and
        sigils to be painted in bright purple or mauve around the handle and “T” crossbar. As you will see, there are
        eight groups of these, the same number as for the Earth pentacle. In fact, all of the tools will have eight sets
        of words and sigils.</span></div>

        occultism. From this standpoint, other associations are incorrect. However, within their own systems, other
        attributions may be totally correct and the traditional system presented here would be “in error.” The only
        moral of this paragraph, if I can call it that, is <span class="italic">if you do not totally understand the
          system you are using, do <span class="bold">not</span> mix it with other systems</span>. It will only cause
        you problems. This is not to say that you cannot blend multiple systems once they are fully comprehended. That
        was a prime achievement of the Golden Dawn. On the other hand, I am aware of a person who could not get involved
        in a Western magickal group (although he tried), then didn’t like the Wiccan group he became involved with
        because it did not have the same magickal traditions. One was too complicated and the other too easy. The result
        is that he has formed his own “Ancient Cabalistic Celtic Coven.” My only regrets are for the students he was
        “teaching” and the problems they may have in the future. It is said that “When the student is ready, the teacher
        will appear.” Unfortunately, this is true even when the student is ready to be mistaught.</span></div>

        <span class="bold1">Kabalistic Psychology</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">It is possible to classify the study of psychology into two broad
        areas: normal and abnormal psychology. Unfortunately, the study of abnormal psychology is beyond the scope of
        this course. If you are interested in this particular field from an occult viewpoint, you will enjoy the book
        <span class="italic">The Secrets of Dr. Taverner</span> by Dion Fortune.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Let us look at normal psychology, starting with Freud. Besides being
        brought up at the end of the Victorian Age, a fact that colored his entire outlook on life, he also came from a
        Jewish background. From his writings, it is clear to even the most casual reader that there is a harmony that
        exists between his thoughts and a rather simple version of psychology as described in the Kabalah. In fact,
        although the Kabalah and Freud argued for the idea of a subconscious or unconscious, many of Freud’s
        contemporaries did not believe such a thing existed! In his later years, Freud said that if he had his life to
        live over again he would spend it in the study of parapsychology rather than psychology. I think it is safe to
        assume that Freud was either consciously or unconsciously influenced by the Kabalah.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As explained in an earlier lesson, Freud divided the mind into three
        categories: id, ego, and superego. In the 1970s a simplified form of Freudianism known as transactional analysis
        (as popularized in the book <span class="italic">I’m Okay, You’re Okay</span>) tried to put the abstract
        Freudian ideas into terms understandable by lay people. Thus, id, ego, and superego were replaced with child,
        parent, and adult, respectively. And it is true that most people can relate better to the idea of a child
        wanting its way, throwing tantrums if he or she doesn’t get it, than to the word “id” that has no easy picture
        in most people’s minds. But the Kabalah goes so much further in its understanding of the mind, that Freud and
        Jung seem like beginners.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">One of the biggest problems with standard psychological theory is that
        it begins with birth or slightly before. Thus, it must fail to answer some basic questions such as “What was my
        mind doing before the inception of my body? If reincarnation is a fact, why do I have trouble remembering past
        lives? And if it is not a fact, why do I have fleeting memories of past lives?” “Why is there such a desire by
        people in cultures all over the world to reunite with God, to be more than they are?” (Jung saw this and called
        it a desire for religion, a basic human instinct which Freud did not acknowledge.) The Kabalah answers this and
        more. Some of this discussion will have to be saved for later during a section on reincarnation, the most
        complete analysis of which has been hidden for centuries within the Kabalah. But for now we must merely look at
        that change known as death.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">No matter what you believe, for argument’s sake, let us assume the
        validity and reality of reincarnation. Let us also assume that you have died and have been reincarnated into a
        newborn infant. According to the Kabalah, the soul enters the body with the first breath the infant takes.
        Perhaps you want to finish that good book you were reading or see that movie you missed just before you died.
        Unfortunately, you discover that your muscles do not work the way you remembered they worked. This is not
        psychological, it’s physiological. Nerves and bones have not finished developing. Various muscular activity
        cannot take place due to this lack of development. You can no longer feed yourself. You can’t communicate
        through speech or writing. You cannot even control your bowels or bladder. After a short while, things that were
        part of your normal existence are now part of a terrifyingly new world.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In order to cope, you must quickly develop new modes of communication.
        You learn that cooing brings smiling, happy faces and warm, protective bodies. You learn that crying brings
        worried looks, your mother’s breast, or a needed change of diapers. In order to survive, your real consciousness
        submerges and a false consciousness arises. Eventually, this false consciousness takes over. It becomes the
        consciousness or ego. It is a covering that is developed so that we can exist. It is necessary, but it is not
        our true self.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">And what of our true self? It has submerged to a point where most
        people rarely if ever allow it to come out. This is especially true in so-called civilized societies. Is it any
        wonder that there is so much rebellion in the world? So many people, instinctively trying to release their true,
        inner selves, seem like rebels without causes.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">But in fact, there is a cause. The true self, the part of us that
        survives what is called death, is not material. Our true self is spiritual and nonmaterial in nature. It is our
        higher self, our direct link to the Divine. It becomes hidden compared to our false, outer self. Our true self,
        our link to the Divine, is part of our unconscious. And there have been so many fights, disagreements, and wars
        caused by people who didn’t know what they really wanted: communion with the Godhead. That is, what is really
        desired is a link to the unconscious, which is linked to the Divine. They wanted to link their conscious to
        their unconscious. This is a main focus of our magickal work. It is the very essence of White Magick.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As you have probably guessed, the Kabalah does not divide the mind
        into the Freudian or transactional analysis’ three main categories, but into ten. In the next column you will
        see how the ten aspects of mind relate to the Tree of Life. The first thing you will notice is the dividing line
        at <span class="italic">the abyss</span>, the space between the upper three Sephiroht and the lower seven. The
        three above are immortal and last for as long as the Divine Source wishes them to exist. The seven below are
        mortal and cease to exist when the body dies. A quick glance will show that the memory is mortal. Thus, it is
        obvious that our memory of past lives will tend to be very minimal at best. Here, then, is an easy explanation
        as to why we tend not to remember much more than hints of our past lives.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The <span class="italic">Yechidah</span> is our True Self, our Link to
        the Divine, our transcendental ego. It relates to what Freud called the “superego.” The <span
          class="italic">Chiah</span> is our True Will. It is the creative and inquisitive inner impulse (from the
        Divine), which causes us to reach outside and inside of ourselves to become better than we are. It makes us try
        harder, to want to be the best and do better than we have done before. This does not imply competition. We all
        can advance together. Sometimes this impulse is subdued, but it always comes back in force. This was exemplified
        by the age of exploration that followed the Dark Ages, and by our current reach into the vastness of space. It
        also explains the urge to commune with the Godhead, to know the joy and ecstasy of the Knowledge and
        Conversation of your Holy Guardian Angel, and to practice White Magick.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre13">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The <span class="italic">Neschamah</span> is the intuition. It is the
        seat of all the psychic abilities of humanity. There is a method of instruction called “the Socratic Method.” As
        you would expect, it is based upon the teaching methods of Socrates. He believed that people did not learn new
        things. Rather, he thought they remembered things that they had forgotten at death before their current
        incarnation. By asking questions, Socrates would elicit from the student answers, which would lead the student
        to the discovery of an idea or principle that the student could not have known. Today, this system of <span
          class="italic">involving</span> a student rather than merely telling a student seems to be the most effective
        way to teach. It allows the student to have a growing, inquiring mind. It also allows for intuitive leaps and
        bounds, resulting in an individual who is creative rather than a robot only capable of rote repetition.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Part of the definition of magick is that it is a science. As magicians
        we should understand modern scientific thought. One such canon of science is the theory of evolution. Evolution
        is not, as many think, a smooth line. Rather, according to some of the latest concepts, it moves in jumps and
        jerks. Current evolutionary thought calls this “punctuated equilibrium.” Likewise, the advancement of mind and
        humanity has often come in sudden steps. The laser was the accidental result of communications research. Today
        lasers are used for everything from playing music to dentistry and brain surgery previously impossible to
        perform even with the sharpest of scalpels. This is an example of a link to the Divine via the unconscious will.
        This uncontrolled link is an aspect of the Neschamah. A controlled link to the Divine is an aspect of the Chiah.
        Thus, from our point of view the Chiah is active and outgoing, while the Neschamah is receptive. As always, it
        is the goal of the Kabalist to blend opposites and bring balance into manifestation. By allowing the Neschamah
        to be in our awareness, we develop psychic abilities. By being conscious of the Chiah, we are able to perform
        magick.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The <span class="italic">Ruach</span> is our consciousness, our
        intellect, our false self. It equates with Freud’s idea of the ego. Notice that it is composed of five parts:
        memory, imagination, reason, desire, and will. The aspect of will related to the Ruach is different from that of
        the Chiah. The Chiah is our True Will. As such, it is in alignment with the will of the Divine. The will of the
        Ruach is that which is moved by our superficial and transitory desires. The True Will of the Chiah is to create,
        to love, and to seek unity with the Godhead. The will aspect of the Ruach is to have sexual release, to eat
        good-smelling food although you know that the food is neither good nor needed, and to be better than those
        around you, even if it means hardships for them or their destruction.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The <span class="italic">Nephesch</span> is the lower self. It is the
        most superficial layer of the unconsciousness, wherein dwells the darker side of ourselves. It is usually under
        the tight control of the Ruach. Earlier I equated the Nephesch with the Freudian id. While correct, it is not
        precise. The id is really a process, not an aspect of the mind. It is frequently submerged and hidden within the
        Nephesch, but it is not exactly the Nephesch. The process called the id, when submerged in the Nephesch, is said
        to be controlled by the Ruach. However, when the Ruach does not control the id and the Nephesch dominates, the
        id is free to roam the aspects of the mind and come out in sometimes unfortunate places. Part of the techniques
        of magick that you have been learning include the control of this id energy so that it can be used as you wish
        under the control of the united Yechidah and Ruach. The Nephesch is also the source of the astral body and the
        seat of the energy called <span class="italic">Praña</span> (correct pronunciation: prahn-yah) in Sanskrit. In
        the Kabalah this energy is also known as Ruach, but should not be confused with the Ruach meaning
        “consciousness.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Note that there is a difference between the energy called Ruach or
        Praña and the id. The id is a process, a motion, while the Ruach or Praña is that which moves. Freud’s original
        definition of the libido, as described earlier in this course, would have made it the same as Praña or Ruach
        energy.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Finally, the bottommost Sephira is related to the <span
          class="italic">G’uph</span>, the physical body. Many people wonder how the body can be an aspect of mind. To
        me, the interrelation is quite obvious on many levels. First, as you incarnate, you “choose” a particular body,
        depending on the types of experiences you need in life (more on this in the discussion of reincarnation). Also,
        imagine the different thoughts of someone born with severe handicaps as opposed to a person born physically
        “normal.” There are also differences in the psyches of people who, according to the dictates of society, are
        considered ugly or are considered beautiful. There are even differences in the psyches of people who tend to be
        slim and those who tend to be obese. The physical body plays an important role as part of the psyche and should
        not be ignored.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">But after all this information, we are left with a feeling of “That’s interesting, but so
        what?” Actually, once you know the basis for Kabalistic psychology there is much that you can do with it. The
        two keys to what you can do are:<div class="calibre24">

          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Let us say that it has been so long since you have been involved in a
        relationship that you cannot feel desire for someone, even though that person indicates a desire for you. A
        possible diagnosis here is that you no longer have the memory of what a loving relationship is like. You need
        something to trigger the memories. Looking at the Tree we can see that what is needed is an infusion of
        imagination (which is linked by a direct path to the Yechidah, our link to the Divine). Contemplating the card
        known as the Hermit will bring imagination back into the memory. Spend a few minutes contemplating the Hermit
        each day for a week. If the goal of bringing up desire has not been achieved, it is probably not because you
        have failed, but because you have not brought the memory down to the level of desire. Contemplation of the Wheel
        of Fortune card for a few minutes a day will help you accomplish this.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Perhaps you feel that you are a very logical person and pride yourself
        on your reasoning talents. From the standpoint of the Kabalah there is absolutely nothing wrong with this. It is
        fine to be proud of your talents, and not to do so would be a lie. But perhaps you feel that you are not
        creative enough in your life. Here, a short period of daily contemplation on the card titled “The Devil” will
        reward you immensely. It does not mean that you will be satanically inspired. Hopefully it will allow you to
        learn about and break out of your “satanic” enthrallment to cold logic and reason. Coming from the other side,
        if you find yourself very creative but with illogical, time-wasting ideas, contemplation of this same card will
        allow reason to enter your world and guide, but not over-control, your imagination.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Thus, neatly packed into the Tree of Life we have a complete system
        not only of psychotherapy, but also a system of dealing with day-to-day situations and improving your life. It
        is also a wonderful way of becoming familiar with the Tree and the Tarot.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Sometime in the future, people will have forgotten that there once was
        a series of “light bulb” jokes which all began, “How many _______s does it take to change a light bulb?” The
        answers were frequently blackly humorous. One version of this joke goes, “How many psychiatrists does it take to
        change a light bulb?” The answer is “Only one, but it has to want to change.” The reason I bring this up is that
        anytime you wish to use magick to change somebody’s mind, <span class="italic">you must ask for that person’s
          permission first</span>. And the person must give it to you. You have no right to change a person even if it
        is for what you think might be the betterment of that person unless that person wants the change. The reason I
        say this is to suggest that you do not go up to a friend who you think needs changing and say, “Here, look at
        this card for three minutes a day for the next week” without telling that person the reason and how it works.
        That person may not want to change in the way you think he or she should.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Changework of this type is not a power grab or doing “something” to
        “someone.” Rather, it is a cooperative effort to make desired changes. If someone asks for your help, fine. If
        he or she agrees with you after being informed of what you are doing, fine. But changing a person’s mind without
        his/her permission is nothing but Black Magick, and you will be the one to suffer most. Start working on
        improving yourself before trying to help others who may be healthier than you think.</span></div>

              everything (gods and demons are just aspects of our unconsciousness) and bow in obeisance to Jung with his
              magickal (but essentially meaningless) idea of synchronicity, if we’re looking at psychology we can’t
              ignore Freud. Freud really began what is the modern method of helping to correct the mind. He opened
              people to new ideas. But ultimately, he was a failure.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Freud began his studies in Paris, where incredible cures were
              achieved through hypnosis. Freud abandoned hypnosis for two reasons. First, he was lousy at it. He was a
              failure at hypnosis. He had horrible bad breath. Would you go into trance when someone leaned close to you
              with breath like that and said “<span class="italic">Sleeeeep!</span>” Not me, and not many of Freud’s
              patients. So he wanted to come up with something that would get the results of hypnosis, without the use
              of hypnosis.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Almost.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">He also saw that cures using hypnosis were very fast. He wanted
              something that would take much longer to achieve the success of hypnosis for a simple reason: he wanted to
              make lots of money. He wanted patients to come back to him for many months or years in order to overcome
              issues that hypnotists helped within a few sessions. So he developed psychoanalysis to take a long time
              and cost a lot of money.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Today, although most training in psychology goes into the study
              of Freudian concepts&mdash;and many are still valid&mdash;few psychiatrists practice Freudian
              psychoanalysis. Newer methodologies have placed analysis on the ash heap of time.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Without Freud, modern psychology would not be what it is today.

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">We all have it to a greater or lesser degree. Many people react
        negatively to hearing this and insist that they are not egotistical. Well, if you don’t have a strong ego,
        something is wrong with you. We all need strong egos, strong senses of self to survive and thrive.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">What we need to do is isolate different aspects of ego from one
        another and eliminate those aspects we no longer desire. That positive aspect of our egos which tells us “I’m

        believe in their own (non-existent) greatness as the result of the adulation of students. One of the reasons
        that I suggest you read at least one other book on the topics of these lessons while you are studying this
        course is so that you will get other opinions and ideas, some of which may contradict the ideas presented here.
        Really, I’m just another human.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In Eastern mystical traditions, the physical, phenomenal world is
        considered an illusion (<span class="italic">maya</span>) which hides the true spiritual reality behind the
        phenomenal world. Our higher self can know the true universe, but it is cut off by our dominant egos, which only
        see the illusion. Thus, our egos “slay” the true, inner reality. We are told that to achieve enlightenment we
        must “slay the slayer,” get rid of our egos and see the inner reality. Crowley wrote about this frequently, yet,
        although he claimed to have succeeded, it is very questionable as to whether he really freed himself from his
        ego.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">According to Israel Regardie, in the West our goal is not to rid
        ourselves of our egos, but to perfect our egos so they are in harmony with our higher selves. I doubt if a large
        percentage of Western mystics have achieved that state. I’m still working on it.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">What both Crowley and Regardie seem to imply is a very mechanistic
        mind. That is, they seem to see the amount of ego reaching a certain level which, by following certain
        instructions, can be raised or lowered. While I have great respect for these two gentlemen, I disagree with this
        viewpoint. The mind seems to be far more flowing and changeable than their mechanistic version. We can quickly
        or gradually change from large to small amounts of negative egotism depending on such things as the weather, our
        health, our physical environment, and perhaps various astrological influences. What we need to have are
        techniques to aid us by first allowing us to sense that a problem exists (i.e., an increase in negative egotism)
        and then give us some ways to deal with it.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">You might be asking yourself why I’m giving you this information now.
        It’s because I want to tell you some more about the pitfalls of leading a group, and my worst failure as a
        teacher.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Several years ago I had a student who I believe had more potential as
        a magician than anyone I had met before or since. I tried to lead him into becoming a good magician, well
        grounded in occult philosophy. Unfortunately, due to differences of opinion between myself and this student we
        ended up going separate ways.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">One of the reasons for this was that he did not like the way I did some of my private
        tutoring. As I discussed earlier, I prefer the Socratic method of teaching. One of my teachers, Dr. Michael
        Turk, gave me a simple explanation of the method:<div class="calibre20">
          <blockquote class="calibre21">

          </blockquote>

        <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">When this student asked me a question, I would answer in a way
        designed to lead him to a deeper understanding of the implications of the question, and not give just a simple
        yes or no. He did not like the idea of having to think about the answers. He wanted a “yes or no” answer to
        complex questions. I refused to give him that which he really wanted: magickal power with no personal
        work.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">About a year after he had stopped being my student, I was asked by an
        international occult order to start a chapter of that order in the city where I then lived. I knew several
        people who would be interested and who might make good members, including this former student. Naturally, on the
        day before I had planned to call him I accidentally ran into him and told him about it. In a short time, he, I,
        and some others were working together. I soon realized that previous commitments would not allow me the time to
        lead the group. Because he had more latent magickal talent and charisma than other members of the group, I chose
        him to be my successor.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This person is very intelligent. He has worked as a secretary for many
        years and because of it has two problems. First, since many secretaries do what they are told and allow their
        bosses to have the responsibility for their success or errors, he has the attitude that magickally he can do
        whatever he wants, and if he errs he can always do it over or use some sort of magickal “white-out” to correct
        the mistakes. This is a very dangerous attitude to have when doing practical magick of the sort he is doing, and
        both he and one of his close assistants have told me of the times when he has “summoned up something” and not
        been able to banish it. Had he been more advanced, the manifestation could have been more physical. The result
        could have been life-threatening.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Second, as a secretary he does what he is told and thus has a feeling
        of impotence and lack of power. I did not realize this at the time I turned the organization over to him. It was
        a big error on my part.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Rather than allowing him to develop more quickly, as I had hoped the
        leadership role would do, the power of being the local head of a group gave him a feeling that he could do
        anything and get away with anything. He began to lie and break his oaths left and right. He tried to give away
        some of the secrets of the order to others so that he might learn the inner secrets of organizations to which
        they belonged. Finally, although remaining a member of the organization, he decided that this order was not
        spiritual at all. So he became a de facto member of a well-known, very authoritarian, pseudo-Hindu order.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Since this pseudo-Hindu group tells its “devotees” when to get up,
        when to go to sleep, what to read, what to think, when to bathe, what to wear, when to have sex, when to eat,
        etc., it seemed to me that this organization would be perfect for this person who was so used to taking orders
        anyway. However, he insisted on continuing in the leadership role of the local group. From what I learned, he
        subtly twisted the teachings and used “politics” to try to get himself into total leadership of the group. He
        also tried to make this pseudo-Hindu order&mdash;a group that has been accused of brainwashing, mind control,
        gun running, and child abuse by many authorities&mdash;look very positive to members of the occult group and
        make several of the pseudo-Hindu devotees into members of the occult group. Fortunately for the occult lodge I
        had founded, his attempt failed, although his lack of focus caused the branch that I started with about ten
        people to fall apart and finally close down.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">When the founder of the pseudo-Hindu group died, there quickly were
        battles to control it, resulting in the formation of new groups, some of which have genuine Hindu interests.
        Unfortunately, my former student became involved with drugs and prostitution. Eventually he overcame both, but
        still looking for the “quick magickal fix,” he became involved in Satanism. I hope he gets his head together
        some day. I still wish him well.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">One of the little-known facts of teaching is that a teacher must
        accept the karma of what he/she teaches. If a teacher’s students use the teachings wisely, it benefits the
        teacher’s karma. If they use the teachings to do negative things, it hurts the teacher’s karma. In this case, I
        have to accept some of this person’s karma (for his using the things I taught him in a negative way). And
        because he messed up some of his students, I also have to accept some of their karma as well. Needless to say,
        there are things I am doing magickally to end this karmic link.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The reason I have gone through this long story is to show you some of
        the problems caused by egotism when forming or being a member of a magickal group. The egotism of S. L.
        MacGregor Mathers, one-time undisputed leader of the Golden Dawn, helped cause the breakup of that organization.
        Crowley’s egotism caused his O.T.O. and A.A. to shrink in numbers until they were very small by the time of his
        death. There are far more people who study and idolize Crowley today than there ever were during his lifetime.
        Egotism and power hunger have broken up more magickal groups, covens, and other such groups than any other
        single cause.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">So how do we avoid the problem of negative egotism in ourselves and others? First, we must
        acknowledge that if it is not on the surface, it is lurking just under the surface. Second, we have to learn how
        to recognize it. A simple way to do this is to look at attitudes. The negative egotistical attitude is presented
        in the book <span class="italic">Krsna (sic) Consciousness, The Topmost Yoga System</span>, by the late founder
        of the Hare Krishnas. In it (p. 40) he says, “Give up research&mdash;throw it away&mdash;just become
        submissive... [listen only to] authorized sources.” Of course, the authorized sources you should listen to and
        the organization you should be submissive to in this case is the Hare Krishnas. On the other hand, look at the
        note at the beginning of Crowley’s <span class="italic">Book 4</span>, the first part of the book <span
          class="italic">Magick</span>:<div class="calibre20">
          <blockquote class="calibre21">
            <div class="calibre19">

                    He [Crowley] says ‘Don’t believe me!’. . . He wants an independent and self-reliant body of students
                    to follow out their own methods of research. If he can save them time and trouble by giving them a
                    few useful ‘tips,’ his work will have been done to his own satisfaction.</span></span></div>

        <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It is with this last viewpoint that I heartily concur.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If you are the head of a group and you find yourself thinking that you
        have all the answers and any other way is wrong, it is time to get to work on yourself. Also, if you find
        yourself thinking you know all there is to know about the Kabalah and magick and occultism, it is time to work
        on yourself.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">For most of us, our sense of “self,” our ego, is based on the link
        between consciousness and body. Even those of us who spend many hours in Astral projection still think of “me”
        as being the mind-body unit. The mind, being non-physical, cannot possess, cannot be superior or inferior,
        cannot have or do anything other than exist and seek unity with the Divine. But when mind-body are thought of as
        one, it can have possessions, can be physically, mentally superior or inferior to other mind-body units. Thus,
        the key to overcoming negative egotism is to realize and accept (not merely understand) that the mind is not the
        body. The mind is the true self and the body is just a servant for that true self when living in the physical
        universe.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The following are gentle versions of techniques, some of which are
        given by Crowley in his books, which will help you in this endeavor.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre24">
      <div class="calibre25">
        <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">1. Sit in a chair, back straight, knees together, feet flat
            on the floor. Your hands should be palms down on your thighs with the thumbs just touching. Now, just hold
            this position. In a short time your body will start to tremble and your legs will move apart and separate
            the thumbs. You will soon learn that this simple, basic position can rapidly become very uncomfortable. The
            body, it turns out, quickly becomes uncomfortable in <span class="italic">any</span> position. Just try to
            lie in any position for a short time and you will see for yourself that this is true. It is possible, with
            practice, to overcome the feelings of pain and discomfort. Since the body becomes painful in any position,
            it must be that something else overcomes the pain. That “something else” is not part of the physical body.
            It is the mind.</span></blockquote>
      </div>
      <div class="calibre25">
        <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">2. When you start to see negative egotism slipping into
            your life, make an agreement with yourself not to say the word “I” for at least two weeks. During that time
            keep a pad of paper with you, and anytime you say the word “I,” put a small mark on a dated page. At first
            the page will be filled with marks, but as you go through the two-week period, the daily number of marks
            will lessen. The effect of not saying the word “I” for a few weeks is quite astonishing. It tends very
            nicely to separate the idea of your self from the mind-body unit. To improve and speed up the result, you
            might wish to give a dollar or a quarter or a dime to your favorite charity for each of your “breaks,” that
            is, each time you say “I.” This exercise is a “charitable” version of Crowley’s technique; he would have you
            slash your arm with a razor blade every time you had a break! I find the method given above quite
            satisfactory and much safer.</span></blockquote>

          <span class="bold1">PART SEVEN</span>
        </span></span></h1>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">I have always found amazing the large number of people who talk magick
        and the tiny amount of people who practice or live magick. The vast majority of people I have met who claim to
        be magicians show little knowledge of any rituals other than simple variations on the LBRP. Luckily, this is
        changing. More and more magicians are really doing magick.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Don’t get me wrong, though. I cannot overstress the importance of the
        LBRP. Becoming proficient in magick is a precarious task, and the LBRP is the rather tiny support:</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If you are not proficient at the LBRP, the entire system can fall down
        around you. This is why the LBRP is taught right at the beginning. In fact, other than initiation rituals, it
        was the <span class="italic">only</span> ritual given out to members of the Golden Dawn until they entered the
        Inner Order. This would take over one year of practice.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre2"><img alt="071" src="images/000059.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Thus, if you start actual practice on a daily basis of other rituals
        such as the Middle Pillar Ritual and the ritual which is to follow, you will be doing the practical work that so
        many people who call themselves magicians talk about, but so few actually practice.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Let me reaffirm to you now that magickal practice is not just
        self-delusion or “mental masturbation.” During sexual stimulation the chemistry of the body actually changes.
        Various hormones are released into the bloodstream, which cause the obvious signs of sexual arousal. Drugs
        called endorphins are created by the body and released into the blood and eventually arrive at the brain.
        Endorphins are similar to opiates and increase the pain threshold. As a result, bites and scratches that at
        other times would be painful become very pleasurable for some people.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">However, the changes due to sexual arousal are temporary. The practice
        of ritual magick will make longer-lasting changes. These include longevity, youthfulness, increased I.Q., and
        others. But unless you practice on a regular basis, nothing will happen. Magick is experiential, not mental. It
        all depends upon what you choose to do or not do.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The purpose of the LBRP, among other things, is to clear your
        immediate area of physical and non-physical distractions. This especially refers to what might be considered
        “negative influences.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">However, when doing Grey Magick it becomes important to clear your
        area not only of lower or negative influences, but also of positive or higher influences. This is because when
        you want to get into contact with one aspect of Divinity, you do not want anything (whether it be positive or
        negative) getting in the way.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Perhaps at some time in your life you have had some people make very
        clear that they have a romantic crush on you. They always want to be around you. They want to help you in every
        way possible and want to touch you as much as possible. Their motivation is completely based on their idea of
        love, yet they can quickly become a terrible annoyance, a “pain in the neck.” Even though they come to you out
        of love and affection&mdash;two things which are undeniably very positive&mdash;they can get in the way of your
        efficient functioning at school, at work, and in your personal and professional life. It may be fun for a short
        while, but soon it only gets in your way. We try to break our admirer of their obsession and stop the
        interference into our life. Similarly, it is important to prevent even positive interference into our magickal
        work. We must clear our immediate area, the area wherein we will work our magick, not only of negative
        influences, but also of positive influences. In short, we want to have an area for magickal work that has been
        cleared of <span class="italic">all</span> influences.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The LBRP clears the area of negative influences. The Banishing Ritual
        of the Hexagram (BRH) clears the area of positive and negative influences from higher planes. Just as with the
        LBRP, the Banishing Ritual of the Hexagram must be mastered.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Although I thoroughly enjoy the LBRP, I have always considered it to
        be on the level of doing my laundry. It is important and must be done regularly, or you can get into trouble.
        For many years I did it on an average of twice a day. I feel good about doing it, too. But I also think that a
        ritual done daily should have “more.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">When I first learned the BRH, I found that “more.” While the Evocation
        of the Archangels in the LBRP is powerful, and it seems to me to always be increasing in power, the Invocations
        and physical actions of the BRH are to me quite awe-inspiring. I never cease to get chills when I pause after
        commanding the Divine Light to descend. And when that section is repeated at the end of the ritual, it is almost
        overpowering. At times I have wanted to cry over this ritual’s magnificent yet simple beauty.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">It may surprise you to know that many rituals of groups such as the Golden Dawn are filled
        with amazing levels of beauty. Is there any more magnificent and beautiful way to “adore the Lord of the
        Universe and Space” than by the Golden Dawn’s:<div class="calibre20">

        east, or if there is not enough room, continue facing east from where you stand. Make the Hexagram of Fire in
        front of you with the wand or index finger. You should visualize it as a golden flame, just as the pentagrams
        from the LBRP upon which the hexagrams are overlaid are in blue flame.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP FOURTEEN</span>. With your wand or the right
        index finger, point to the center of the Fire hexagram and move around the circle to the south. This matches
        what you did in the LBRP. If there is not enough room to “circumambulate,” simply turn in place. Coming from the
        tip of the finger or wand you should see the formation of an intense, bright white line. This goes over the
        bright white line that connects the pentagrams of the LBRP. When you reach the south, form the hexagram of Earth
        in bright golden flame. Inhale and exhale the energy as before, and make the sign of the Enterer toward the
        middle of the Earth hexagram (the center of the interlacing triangles). As you do so, vibrate the word of power:

        pivot to the west, carrying the brilliant white line. At this direction form the hexagram of Air. Repeat the
        charging process, again pointing to the center of the hexagram (at the middle of the common base lines). Vibrate
        the word of power: <span class="bold">ARARITA</span>.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP SIXTEEN</span>. Move or pivot to the north,
        carrying the white line. Here form the hexagram of Water. The middle of the hexagram is where the apexes of the
        triangles meet. This is where you point when you vibrate the power word: <span
          class="bold">ARARITA</span>.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP SEVENTEEN</span>. Carry the white line from
        the north back to the east, completing the circle of white light with the golden hexagrams at the quarters. If
        you have had room to move about rather than pivoting in place, return to your position in the middle of the
        circle, in front of the altar (if you have one, otherwise the middle of the circle). Face east.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">At this time you should have around you the blue pentagrams from the

        incredibly intense, bright and virtually pulsating with energy. They should be just short of blinding in

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In this section, the three ritualists can stand in a line in front of
        the altar, with Person 1 to the right or south, Person 2 to directly in front of the altar, and Person 3 to the
        left or north. They should all be facing east. For the formulation of the hexagrams, you can have one person
        stand at each quarter. Have the first person do the appropriate part at the east and carry the line to the
        south. At this corner, the second person forms the hexagram, charges it with <span class="bold">ARARITA</span>,
        and carries the line to the west. While this is being done, Person 1 moves quickly clockwise to the north. Here
        the third person does the appropriate part and carries the line to the north. The person at the north finishes
        by doing the appropriate hexagram and carrying the line to the east. After Person 2 and Person 3 have finished
        their appropriate portion and the carrying of the connecting line to the next quarter, they continue in a
        clockwise direction around the inside of the circle and return to the quarter where they began. Thus, at the end
        of this section, each ceremonialist is back at the quarter at which he or she started this section of the
        ritual.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">When the formulation of the hexagrams is complete and everyone is back
        at his/her original station, all turn inward and face the center. Together they should raise their right hands
        (with wands if they have them) straight up in the air. They should slowly bring them down so that they are
        parallel with the ground and pointing at the ritualist(s) in the center who will finish the ritual.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As they lower their hands they should start intoning the vowel “AH”
        quietly and in a low tone. As they move their arms the sound should raise in pitch and volume so that by the
        time they are pointing straight ahead the “AH” sound should be very high in pitch and quite loud. A preselected
        person, when he or she feels it is right, should suddenly raise his/ her arm, which signals the ritualist to
        finish and be quiet. Then they should lower their arms (keeping the wands pointing up, though), and return to
        their seats in the circle.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I have found this ceremonial version of the Banishing Ritual of the
        Hexagram to be moving, spiritually powerful, and magickally effective.</span></div>

        </span></span></h1>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">One of the things which I will not be discussing in depth during this
        course is the subject of astrology. I mention this here so that you do not notice its lack later on and think
        that I am anti-astrology. Nothing could be further from the truth. I have had the honor of knowing several
        excellent astrologers who have amazed me with their talents. I even have one friend who insists that magick and
        astrology are inextricably linked. He has gone so far as to design his own magickal system based upon art and
        astrology.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The plain fact of the matter is that for the systems of magick taught
        in these lessons, only a minimal amount of astrological knowledge is necessary. Most of it can be understood by
        comprehending the Tree of Life rather than recourse to deep study of astrology. On the other hand, the better
        you know astrology, the better you will understand the Tree of Life. So although a knowledge of astrology is not
        needed for this course, it is suggested that you do learn something about the subject.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Ah, the easy way. So many people are looking for it. The pages of
        tabloids are filled with ads offering instant fame, memory, money, love, and success. Other offers include
        simple “spell kits” designed to allow you to curse your neighbor even if you have had no magickal training
        whatsoever. Unfortunately, there is no such thing as an instant gift of magickal powers. They must be earned as
        the result of three things: <span class="italic">practice, practice, practice!</span> I have said it before and
        I am repeating it here: to become a magician, to develop psychic-magickal powers requires work and study. If you
        think there is a shortcut . . . you lose.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As an example of what I mean I would like to describe an ad I saw
        repeated several times in a national magazine. It was a full-page ad, the center of which showed a drawing of a
        hand holding a small stick. The ad proclaimed that you could “make good luck your slave” with the “Miracle
        Stick.” This stick could allegedly bring you anything. If you read the small print of the ad you learned that
        the stick must be burned, and if you examine the drawing closely, you will see that the stick being held by the
        disembodied hand is just a stick of incense! The price was many times the retail value of the incense.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The distributor of the item would not be putting out full-page ads if
        people were not sending in their money. Thus, especially with occult items purchased through the mail or over
        the Internet, I give you this ancient warning: <span class="italic">caveat emptor</span>: “let the buyer
        beware!” And from this warning I jump to ancient grimoires.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">So far in this course I have hardly touched the subject of the ancient
        textbooks of magick known as the “grimoires.” Some of the famous ones, which are still available, include <span
          class="italic">The Greater Key of Solomon</span>, <span class="italic">The Lesser Key of Solomon</span>
        including <span class="italic">The Goetia, The Grimoire of Armadel, The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abra-Melin
          the Mage,</span> and <span class="italic">The Secret Grimoire of Turiel</span>. Some books, such as <span
          class="italic">The Secret Lore of Magic</span> by Idries Shah and <span class="italic">The Book of Ceremonial
          Magic</span> by A. E. Waite, are nothing but compilations of other grimoires such as the ones
        mentioned.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If these books are so powerful, wouldn’t it have been easier for me
        just to say, “Go buy them and follow the instructions carefully”? Unfortunately, it is not that easy. That is
        why so many of the above-named volumes are printed and purchased, but so little real magick is done. There is a
        little-known key to unlocking their secrets and learning how to successfully use them.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This key is found in the idea behind the word that describes these
        texts: <span class="italic">grimoire</span>. It is a French word. The direct translation of it is “black book,”
        but it has the meaning “grammar book,” which were frequently in black bindings. It was expected that a student
        of magick would have a teacher to instruct him or her in the subtleties of the various planes of existence, and
        how to alter them through the knowledge and use of universal laws. Grimoires were not meant to give out every
        bit of magickal knowledge. They were designed to aid a student’s memory. They are, in a sense, nothing more than
        class notes.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Once this is understood, instead of looking at what is included in
        these books, notice what is <span class="italic">omitted</span> . In the grimoires, the knowledge of karma or
        tee-koon and the need to do a divination before doing any Grey Magick is never discussed. The teacher would have
        instilled these ideas very strongly into the head of a student.</span></div>

        </span></span></h3>
    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">This is the first of the three necessities. If you don’t think that
        your magick will work, it won’t. This should not imply, however, that magick is nothing more than mental
        techniques. There are many cases of the techniques of standard allopathic (Western) medicine being overpowered
        by a negative mental attitude. This is not because the medical treatment was nothing more than a placebo.
        Rather, it is because the mind and body are intimately connected and one cannot be cured if the other is not
        cured. Similarly, if the mind is not positive toward the magick you are doing, it can defeat your practical
        techniques. It is impossible to be successful as a magician if you are not positive that your magick will
        work.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">This second necessity is just what you have been learning to do in the

        </span></span></h3>
    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">The third necessity is the knowledge of what to do with the energy
        once that energy has been raised and can be controlled.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The ancient magickal student would learn that he or she must have a
        positive attitude, and would also do hours of exercises to learn how to generate and control energy (just as you
        have been doing). But memorizing large quantities of knowledge as to what to do with that energy would be
        difficult for anyone. This is true even for those who lived in periods where techniques of memory were far more
        in practice than they are today. Thus, this knowledge aspect of magick was written down to aid the student and
        help the student avoid possibly dangerous mistakes. It is these workbooks that are known as grimoires. We will
        deal with some of the methods of these texts in later lessons in this course.</span></div>

          <span class="bold1">PART ONE</span>
        </span></span></h1>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Stress affects us all. Stress can be caused by hearing or reading
        about politics or economics, job worries and situations, relationship ups and downs, health issues, and other
        major concerns. It can also be caused by little things such as a phone call that hangs up just as you answer, or
        getting stuck in a traffic jam. Although stress generally affects people more in cities, even living in rural or
        country areas can be stressful. Trying to decide what to make for dinner, trying to deal with increasing prices
        and decreasing returns on money spent, and trying to get parts for vehicles and having to wait weeks for their
        delivery are just some minor examples of what can cause stress.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Being “stressed out” can really make life miserable. Symptoms of not
        being able to deal with stress include lack of focus and the inability to make decisions. It can decrease your
        ability to tolerate things other people do and prevent you from getting needed rest. Virtually any health
        problem you have might be amplified by stress, and it can be the direct cause of pain, heart disease, digestive
        problems, depression, obesity, skin conditions such as eczema, and many other physiological issues.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Actually, stress <span class="italic">per se</span> has a bad
        reputation. We experience stress all the time and need some level of stress to function. All of our muscles work
        through stress and relaxation. The stress of wanting to live in a nice house or apartment and have regular meals
        keeps some people active and creative in their work. So stress is not the issue. Rather, it is stress beyond our
        tolerance levels and our inability to deal with and overcome that excess stress that is the problem.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Unfortunately, we often don’t recognize (excess) stress or its effects
        on us. Worse, even some psychological professionals who should be helping people with this may not recognize it.
        A few years ago a friend of mine appeared very stressed out. She was desperate over a variety of issues (job,
        friends, family) and didn’t know what to do. What shocked me most was that she had been going to a psychologist
        for over a year. “Has your psychologist given you any strategies for dealing with stress?” I asked. She
        responded that this had not even been discussed. I should add that she was also under the care of a psychiatrist
        who was prescribing powerful psychoactive drugs. In spite of all this professional care, she was still stressed
        out and it was harming her physically, mentally, and emotionally.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Luckily, she was strong and determined. She combined yoga,
        acupuncture, and hypnotherapy to wean herself from the drugs. She stopped seeing her psychologist. She still
        gets stressed from time to time, but she has strategies for dealing with it. In fact, she now teaches classes on
        stress reduction at her place of work.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The relaxation ritual given previously is one of the best ways for
        getting rid of stress. You could pay hundreds of dollars and learn some version of this technique from a
        psychologist, purchase CDs or MP3s with something like it recorded on them, or get it out of a book. Don’t
        ignore it, because it <span class="italic">is</span> powerful and it does work. To perform it well, however, may
        take more time than you have available. Thus, to remedy this problem, I am presenting here what I call the
        Instant Relaxation Ritual. It is not meant to replace the relaxation ritual, but can take its place occasionally
        when you are short of time. It is a good way to get rid of or minimize excess stress in your everyday
        life.</span></div>
    <h2 class="calibre29"><span class="calibre30">
        <span class="bold1">The Instant Relaxation Ritual</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre12"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">This can be done standing, sitting, or lying
          down.</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP ONE</span>. Start by tensing all of the
        muscles in your feet and ankles.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP TWO</span>. Without relaxing the tension in
        your feet, tense the muscles of your calves.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP THREE</span>. In a similar manner, tense the
        muscles of your thighs, hips, stomach, chest, back, arms, hands, neck and head. In other words, tense every
        muscle in your body, starting at the feet and ending with the head. Hold your body in this totally tensed
        condition for five to ten seconds.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP FOUR</span>. Take a deep breath and hold it
        for a brief moment. Then, suddenly, as you let all of your breath flow easily and effortlessly out of your
        lungs, simultaneously relax all of your muscles. Permit your body to go as limp as the position you are in will
        allow. Just let go. Completely. Just let go.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP FIVE</span>. With your mind, “look” through
        your body for any tension. Be especially aware of the neck, forehead, shoulders, stomach, and lower back. If
        there is any tension, immediately send the “golden glow” of the relaxation ritual to that area and allow the
        tension to fade. Enjoy this very relaxed and stress-free condition.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Caution</span>: Unlike the standard relaxation
        ritual, this technique is physiological as well as psychological. The sudden change in muscle tension and its
        sudden release may, in a very few people, cause a muscle spasm commonly known as a “charlie horse.” If this
        occurs, stop immediately and deeply massage the area until the spasm ends. Then do the regular relaxation ritual
        as soon as possible. If you are a person who gets a charlie horse, do not shy away from using this technique.
        Once your body becomes used to the sudden change in muscle tension and stress diminution, the spasms should
        cease and you will have a wonderful and fast system of relaxation and stress reduction. Also, I have found that
        such a spasm is more likely to occur when sitting or lying, so if you are one of the few to whom this happens,
        you might practice this several times while standing to acclimatize the body to the sudden physiological change.
        After several positive experiences with this ritual while standing, change back to a sitting or reclined
        position.</span></div>

        <span class="bold1">The Water Element</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">While becoming familiar with our system of the elements, we have
        covered Earth and Air. If after working the exercises for those elements you are not satisfied with your sense
        of unity with them and control of them, continue with the exercises for another two weeks. Then perform them
        sporadically as you will. Also, please remember that I am just a teacher. If you can come up with some exercises
        that will help you become more familiar with the elements, feel free to incorporate them into your work. Don’t
        feel limited to the exercises and techniques shared in these lessons. Instead, think of them as a start to your
        explorations. However, even if you continue working on the previous two elements, you should begin the exercises
        below immediately.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre12"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">The element of Water has the qualities of being
          cool and moist</span>.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Exercise 1</span>. Observe those things around
        you which have the combined qualities of coolness and moistness. Remember, all of these elemental qualities are
        relative. If you open an oven wherein something is being baked, you will be greeted by a warm (or hot) blast of
        damp air. On first consideration, it may not seem to have the quality of coolness along with the moistness.
        However, it is much cooler and more moist than the heat from a smelting furnace. Therefore, the oven has more of
        the element of Water than does the smelting furnace. The smelting furnace has more of the element of Water than
        does the Sun. See if you can determine relative watery qualities as you experience them. Make a note of all of
        these things and record your list in your magickal diary. Do this exercise daily for one week.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Exercise 2</span>. Remove your clothes and enter
        a pool or bath where the water is cool. If you have access to a lake or river, this would be best. Also, it
        would be good if you could get a swimming snorkel so that you can breathe while completely submerged beneath the
        surface of the water. Obviously, this would be difficult to do in a small bath tub or in a shallow pool, but if
        you have access to a snorkel and a place where you can be totally submerged, you will have the quickest
        success.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Once you are submerged as much as possible&mdash;and if you are
        completely submerged, breathing comfortably through the snorkel&mdash;do the relaxation ritual. Thanks to the
        buoyant quality of water you will find that this is quite easy. Next, become very aware of your breath. You
        don’t have to “do” anything, just observe it as you inhale and exhale. As you do this you will find that your
        respiration will automatically slow down. Notice the way the air feels as it comes in through the nose (or
        through the snorkel and mouth), down the air pipe and into the lungs. Sense or imagine the interchange of oxygen
        and carbon dioxide within the lungs. Feel the CO<sub class="calibre34">2</sub>-laden air as it leaves your
        body.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Now imagine that your entire body is nothing but an enormous breathing
        apparatus. Imagine that every part of your body only has the function of breathing. Know that your skin is a
        vital part of this system. In this pore breathing exercise, as you breathe in air, imagine that every pore of
        your body is breathing in elemental Water. Feel it as it washes in and out of you, flushing the impurities from
        your entire body. Do not confuse elemental Water with physical water or you may get a drowning sensation. If
        this happens, stop the exercise immediately and try it again another time.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Experiment with this exercise at different times of the day, and if
        possible, at different locations. Water is not very compressible, but it is very changeable. Try to experience
        it in its many variations. After a week of doing this exercise go on to the next one.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Exercise 3</span>. Spend a period of up to three
        minutes (but no more), once a day, <span class="italic">imagining that you are the element Water</span>. Feel
        the fluidity, the coolness, the refreshing moistness of the elemental waters. If you study astrology, compare
        what you learn about the element of Water with those signs that are of the Water Triplicity (Cancer, Scorpio,
        and Pisces). Become familiar with water in all of its various appearances. Know what water feels like; what
        water is. Practice this exercise for one week.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Exercise 4</span>. Once you have learned how to
        “be” elemental Water, the next step is to learn how to consciously control this element. Take a moment and again
        imagine yourself to be elemental Water. Bring the feeling from the last exercise into your consciousness. Next,
        hold your hands nine to twelve inches apart with the palms facing each other. Now imagine or visualize to the
        best of your ability a bottle, cylinder, or small cask between your hands, Next, as you exhale, visualize all of
        the Water element that is in you going out with your breath and being deposited in the container between your
        hands. Four to seven breaths should be enough to fill it. Once it is filled, observe it for a short time. Then,
        with three breaths, inhale it back into yourself and return to normal consciousness. Spend a week performing
        this exercise at least once daily.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">The Test</span>. Once again, here is a simple
        self-test to allow you to see whether or not you really have become not only in harmony with the element of
        Water, but also its master. No one else will ever inspect your work, so practice the exercises and take the test
        as often as you like. To become a good magician necessitates that you are capable of controlling all of the
        elements.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The next time you feel hardheaded, unwilling to change, and overly
        tense with your muscles hard as a rock, form the container of Water as described in the previous exercise. Once
        the container has been filled, inhale the contents with one big inhalation. Bring all of the contents into you.
        Within five minutes you should be more relaxed and reasonable.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The next time that you are being pushed around or are acting
        “wishy-washy,” again form the container of Water before you. Make sure it is filled. Then visualize a large,
        black hole in the air before you and throw the container into this hole. Immediately visualize the hole sealing
        up after you have cast the container into it. In a few minutes you should feel less overly flexible and not as
        liable to allow others to take advantage of you. It may be necessary to repeat this “black hole” several times
        to have complete success.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">When you have passed both parts of the test to your satisfaction, you
        will be the master of the element Water. Again, as I have already stated, you may find one or more of the
        elements easy to master while others may take time. Just keep practicing without “lusting for results” and
        eventually the outcomes you desire will be yours. Record all the results of your experiments and tests in your
        magickal diary. This means the successes and the failures.</span></div>

        <span class="bold1">The Chalice</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">The chalice is the weapon or tool that represents elemental Water. It
        is the easiest weapon to construct because all you have to do is buy a stemmed goblet and paint it. It requires
        virtually no construction. Although most people prefer a silver goblet, the Golden Dawn suggested the use of a
        stemmed glass. Other people prefer wood or pewter. The choice of material is up to you, although I must say that
        a glass can be a problem due to a high potential for breakage over time.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre13">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The shape of the goblet above the stem should resemble a crocus
        flower. Thus, it should flare out (see diagram on the next page) at the top. Take a piece of twine or “kite
        string” and cut a piece equal to the circumference of the goblet at the point where it begins to flare out. Fold
        the measure in half and use a felt-tip pen to mark the string at that point. Take the folded string and again
        fold it in half. Mark both parts of the string at the fold. Repeat this process one more time and mark all four
        points of the string at the fold. The result of this will be a length of string divided into eight equal
        sections.</span></div>

          blank.</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre13">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Prepare the goblet for paint according to the paint’s instructions.
        Make sure the paint is appropriate for the type of material of which the goblet is made. Although it will be
        rare to drink out of the chalice, you may do so at times. Therefore, <span class="italic">make sure the paint
          you use does not contain any lead or other potentially poisonous substances</span>. Take the string and place
        it around the goblet just below the flare. Using a soft pencil (on wood, a pin will work), make a mark on the
        goblet over the marks on the string. Using bright orange paint, connect the marks on the goblet to the stem with
        straight lines. Above these lines, on the flare part of the goblet, connect the lines with a sort of “curved
        triangle” (see diagram). Fill in these spaces with bright blue paint. On the following page you will find the
        appropriate sigils and Hebrew words for the chalice. The Hebrew should appear in the rectangular section and the
        sigil(s) should be drawn within the curved triangle section. Use orange paint to draw the sigils and Hebrew. To
        protect the finish, use several coats of a clear plastic such as Varathane over your work.</span></div>

                from the LBRP. The LBRP ritual will protect you, but it also lights up the entire astral plane with its
                lines and pentagrams. It is very powerful. It can also have the effect of attracting the attention of
                sometimes unwanted astral entities (Little Nasties), as we have already discussed. The Rose Cross
                Ritual, on the other hand, works like a curtain by containing your aura. It will protect you from
                unwanted outside influences in a different way. Do not substitute the Rose Cross Ritual for the LBRP. Be
                sure to do the LBRP before any magickal ritual. Use the Rose Cross Ritual for self-enclosure. As an
                example, if you feel troubled and cannot focus your attention, do the LBRP to banish any outside
                influences that may be distracting you. Follow this with the Rose Cross Ritual to regain your peace of

                    behind and turned on the red light. I thought I had missed some variable in my magick and it had
                    failed, but to my surprise, delight, and relief, they pulled over the car next to me, even though we

        <span class="bold1">The Tetragrammaton and the Pentagrammaton</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">The Tetragrammaton is dealt with elsewhere in this course, but due to
        its central importance to magick and the Kabalah it will avail us to go over it again. The Tetragrammaton is
        composed of four Hebrew letters: Yud, Heh (superior), Vahv, and Heh (inferior). This four-letter name
        (“Tetragrammaton” means “four-letter name”) is considered to be the ultimate name of Divinity. No one knows the
        correct pronunciation of this word. Some of the letters may have been pronounced differently than they are
        today. The letters may have been a code for other letters. Some of the letters may have been doubled. Today,
        Jews do not attempt to say this word. Instead, they say “Ah-doh-nye,” which means “my lord.” There are no vowels
        in the original Hebrew. They were added much later in the form of points and lines written above, within, and
        below the letters. To ensure that no one would try to pronounce the Tetragrammaton by mistake, the vowels for
        Ah-doh-nye were placed around the holy four letters. If you try to pronounce the four-letter word using these
        vowels you end up with something like the following: Yahveh, Yahweh, Yehovah, or Jehovah. All of these result
        from an incorrect understanding of Hebrew.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The secret of the Tetragrammaton is in the meaning of its component
        letters. The Yud represents archetypal masculinity and the Heh (superior) represents archetypal femininity. The
        Vahv, which looks like an elongated Yud, represents physical masculinity while the second Heh, the Heh inferior,
        represents physical femininity. Thus the Tetragrammaton signifies that the ultimate secret that the Godhead is
        the union of all dualities (i.e., male and female), both physically and spiritually. The Divine is everything,
        and everything comes from and is of the Godhead.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This does not mean, however, that to know the universe is to know the
        Divine. Merely because everything is of the Godhead does not mean that the Divine cannot be more than everything
        that exists or could exist. Divinity is more. The Source of All is beyond comprehension except for the ways in
        which the Godhead chooses to be comprehended.</span></div>
    <h3 class="calibre32"><span class="calibre33"><span class="italic1">
          <span class="italic1"><span class="bold1">Shin and Jesus</span></span>
        </span></span></h3>
    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">The letter Shin (<img alt="209" src="images/000157.jpg"
          class="calibre11" />) looks like three small flames. This letter represents the flame of Divinity, what is
        sometimes called Holy Spirit or Ruach El-oh-heem. It is also known as chi, ki, prana, kundalini, mana, Manitou,
        and many others. If the letter Shin is placed in the center of the Tetragrammaton, we get the Pentagrammaton
        (five-letter name). This new word (Yud, Heh, Shin, Vahv, Heh) is a symbol representing the union of divine
        masculinity and femininity with physical masculinity and femininity by way of the Holy Spirit. Biblically, any
        person who would be a savior or messiah to himself or herself must be able to unite Divinity with physicality
        and this union of all opposites comes by way of the Holy Spirit. Thus, any savior must <span
          class="italic">be</span> this five-lettered name, the Pentagrammaton. If you pronounce the Pentagrammaton in
        Hebrew, it would be “Yeh-hah-shu-ah” (some people today use “Yeh-heh-shu-ah” or even “Yeh-shu-ah”), which is
        usually translated as Joshua. However, in Greek it became Yay-su, which in English became Jesus.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Thus, the name “Jesus” isn’t a name at all. It’s a title or
        description. <span class="italic">Anyone</span> can come to hold the title. The process described by the
        Pentagrammaton is that each of us must find our own union with Divinity. We cannot have a vicarious atonement.
        Nobody can rid us of our past, present, and future karma or “sins.” Each of us must be our own savior, our own
        messiah. Each of us must become “Jesus.” This is a policy of personal responsibility. We cause what happens in
        our lives. We are not victims of fate or some “Lords of Karma.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This, by the way, is strict Kabalah. It has <span
          class="italic">nothing</span> to do with Christian theology. In fact, Christian theology tends to disagree
        with this Kabalistic understanding of the Pentagrammaton. In orthodox Christianity today, Jesus was a specific
        human and God, although many Christians didn’t believe that Jesus was ever a literal human until it was voted to
        be part of the accepted belief system in 325 C.E. I know many of you reading this may not believe it, especially
        if you come from a Christian background. So I say don’t take my word for it. Check it out for yourself.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Another form of the Pentagrammaton puts the Shin between the Vahv and
        the second Heh. This gives the word “Yeh-hoh-vah-shah.” It represents the unity of masculine and feminine on the
        physical plane by way of the Ruach El-oh-heem (Holy Spirit of the Divine) and is presided over by the union of
        archetypal masculinity and femininity. This is, by the way, one of the secrets of Tantric yoga and sex magick,
        but that is left for another lesson.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre2"><img alt="084" src="images/000194.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I also want to assure you that this is not sexist in nature. If you do
        not like the terms male and female, masculine and feminine, they can be replaced by such terms as Yin and Yang,
        positive and negative (as in the sense of the terminals of a battery, not in the sense of good and bad),
        projective and receptive, electric and magnetic, etc. The reason I use male and female is because it has
        traditionally been used and also was used by the ancient Kabalists, sometimes in even more anthropomorphic
        forms. It was their attempt to deal with the dualities which exist everywhere in nature. I am merely following
        their traditional lead.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Finally, I want to repeat that the symbol known as the cross far
        antedates the birth of Christianity and should <span class="italic">not</span> be considered a Christian symbol
        when used for magickal purposes. I read somewhere that there were over 200 forms of crosses in use before
        Christianity began. In this ritual it represents the four elements (the four bars of the cross) and the union of
        physical (the horizontal bar) and spiritual (the vertical bar). The rose, which in the ritual is indicated by a
        circle, represents the unfolding of the soul and the evolution of consciousness.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Those of you who have read this far will have learned by now that
        magick is work and study. After the next lesson we will be moving on to the realm of Grey Magick. By studying
        the material, performing the rituals, and practicing the techniques you have earned this right. You have become
        versed in elementary occult philosophy and the Kabalah, as well as many other related topics.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Now, because you have reached this point, I want to give you something
        special. As I said before, I cannot initiate you. And, as I have described, although initiation is not
        necessary, it can speed up your progress. Even though I cannot initiate you, there is something <span
          class="italic">you</span> can do which can aid in your development. It is a self-dedication, wherein you
        dedicate yourself to the Great Work: attaining the Knowledge and Conversation of your Holy Guardian Angel (also
        known as cosmic consciousness, enlightenment, and unity with Divinity) and the bringing of Spiritual Light to a
        dark world.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If you choose to do this, you must have an altar as described in an
        earlier lesson. It sits in the middle of your magickal circle at the conjunction of the four elements, which
        come from the four quarters. It also represents the physical universe, and thus symbolizes the idea that the
        universe of the magickal circle is far larger than the material plane. If you contemplate the altar, you will
        surely come up with many more things the altar can represent.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">On the top of the altar, besides the magickal tools, should be two additional items. These
        are a red triangle and a white cross. While they can ideally be made of painted wood or metal, they can also be
        made out of construction paper or felt. The cross represents our vow to follow the Great Work (our “cross to
        bear”). The triangle, which should be made so that it looks like three bars rather than one piece with a solid
        middle, represents all forms of trinities. This includes Isis, Apophis, Osiris; Tao, Yin, Yang; Keter, Hochmah,
        Binah; body, mind, spirit; and especially Light, Life, and Love. As you face east from behind the altar, these
        two symbols should rest on the altar with the cross just above the triangle:<div class="calibre2"><img alt="087"
            src="images/000106.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>
        <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Be sure to read the dedication vow below and make sure that you want
        to keep all of its provisions before actually doing this ritual. At this time, do not change the vow. After you
        have completed this course, you may wish to add to it. At that time you can repeat this entire ritual with your
        new vow.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Within the circle you should also have a small cup of water and some
        burning incense. They should not be on the altar, but to the sides. The incense should be to the south and the
        water should be to the north. Be sure that the censer is on a fire-proof surface.</span></div>

        <span class="bold1">Past Lives</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">A topic that deeply concerns many occultists is the “magickal memory.”
        To Crowley, the magickal memory was an important part of occultism. And, like many aspects of occultism, under
        another name it has become a popular topic with the general public. Thus, it becomes hard today to discover
        anyone who is not familiar with some theory of reincarnation and past lives.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Sooner or later you will have a past-life experience as a result of
        your occult work. It may be in the form of a vision during meditation. Or, perhaps in the midst of a group
        ritual the appearances of the hall wherein you are working, the clothes and even the faces of the people with
        whom you are working will alter either subtly or dramatically. You may have the impression that you are in
        another location and working with other people. These are all signs of a returning magickal memory.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Before discussing the Kabalistic theory of reincarnation, I want to
        make clear the importance of past-life experiences. To be quite frank, I am not convinced that reincarnation is
        an <span class="italic">objective</span> reality. The scientific evidence for it is too scant, too
        non-repeatable, and at times too silly to take the whole thing seriously. I have met several dozen people who
        have told me that they were Jesus’ disciples in a past life. I do not know where they were hiding in the
        Christian Bible’s accounts, wherein only twelve are mentioned. One lady told me in all seriousness that she and
        I had “studied Kabalah together at Jesus’ feet.” I found that very interesting, as I had done some past-life
        regressions to that time and further back, and according to my experiences had never even been to the Middle
        East. I even knew two ladies who were lovers, one of whom thought she was an incarnation of Jesus, the other of
        whom thought she had been Judas! This certainly told more about their present-day psyches than their past lives.
        In fact, their present-day relationship resulted in them almost destroying each other mentally and
        spiritually.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I also know of several people who claim to be the current incarnation
        of Aleister Crowley. I have a letter from one of these self-avowed incarnations that shows a total lack of
        knowledge of Crowley’s philosophy and an even smaller knowledge of the English language. Even if you think
        little of Crowley, his mastery of English is beyond question. On the other hand, I have a friend who insists
        that all of the many people claiming to be Crowley actually may be Crowley. He says there must be at least
        thirty-three people making the claim to be Crowley, and they each have about one thirty-third of Crowley’s
        intelligence, talent, skill, and wit. Dion Fortune, in her book <span class="italic">Sane Occultism</span>
        (which should be required reading for all occultists), writes: “To claim greatness in the past does not so much
        cast reflected glory on a mediocre present life as suspicion on the intervening lives . . .”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">Past-life experiences are one of three things:<div class="calibre24">
          <div class="calibre25">
            <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">1. They may be real experiences of actual past lives.
                This could be individual, genetic, or grouped.</span></blockquote>
          </div>
          <div class="calibre25">
            <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">2. They may be fantasies to glamorize a current
                lifetime in which a person feels irrelevant or insignificant.</span></blockquote>
          </div>
          <div class="calibre25">
            <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">3. They may be messages, which your subconscious needs
                to give to your conscious, but which your conscious refuses to hear. Thus, the subconscious presents
                them in a way that can be accepted by the conscious: as a symbolic past life.</span></blockquote>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Point one requires a bit of explanation. It’s fairly obvious that an
        individual past life could be just that. It’s the idea that your consciousness is a continuation of the
        consciousness during a lifetime before the current one. It’s what most people think of when they hear the term
        “reincarnation.” Genetic reincarnation is based on the idea that the DNA may carry certain memories. If this is
        true, a memory of a past life may actually be the memory of an event experienced by your great-great-grandmother
        or some other close or distant blood relative.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The concept of a grouped memory or “pool of souls” is rapidly gaining
        popularity. The concept is simple: after death, your consciousness and its memories, along with the
        consciousness and memories of everyone else, goes into a group or pool. People who are incarnating can take
        memories from that pool according to what they need for spiritual evolution in the upcoming lifetime. This pool
        is open to anyone and everyone. Therefore, literally hundreds of people could be having memories of being
        Napoleon or Cleopatra. And they all could be accurate.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The truth, however, is that it <span class="italic">does not
          matter</span> which is the cause of a past-life experience. What matters is what you get out of it <span
          class="italic">now</span>, in your current lifetime. If you re-read the section on the soul or personality
        according to the Kabalah in an earlier lesson, you will see that the memory is mortal; it ceases with the
        physical end of the body at the change known as death. Thus, if we do have a past-life experience, not only does
        it tend to be short and incomplete, but it also must be important enough to have made an impression on one of
        the immortal aspects of our being. And whether it is an actual memory, an important message from our
        subconscious or an ego-building fantasy, the message we should get out of the past-life experiences is the same:
        What can I learn from it now?</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Frequently, the answer to this question deals with allowing us to
        learn some way of living better in the present. Sometimes they give cathartic experiences, which can free us
        from phobias and neuroses that are no longer valuable to our physical and mental well-being. Sometimes they tell
        us more about our inner makeup and desires.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Past-life experiences are, always have been, and ever must be very
        personal in nature. To be of any value at all, we must personally experience them. Sooner or later, as a result
        of doing the Great Work, experience them you will. Once experienced they can make drastic, positive changes in
        your life. They can also improve your magickal talents by freeing you from problems which might be holding you
        back. However, they can only do so if you pay attention to the lessons they hold.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Unfortunately, whenever there is something of true value, it seems
        that there is also either a cold-blooded opportunist trying to make a fast buck or a self-deluded believer who
        must help everyone . . . and make a few bucks in the process. These people can be found at “psychic fairs” and
        giving classes or lectures, the main part of which features them telling you about your past lives. If you
        accept these people as entertainers, you may get your money’s worth. They may actually be tapping into and
        informing you of real past lives (assuming such exist). But for magickal purposes <span class="italic">they are
          useless</span>. As I said, for them to be of any value to you whatsoever <span class="italic">you</span> must
        experience your past lives&mdash;just hearing about them is magickally valueless. Luckily, there are now
        teachers who are helping people to relive their past lives, and your participation in such a class is
        encouraged. There are also many fine books on the market that tell you how to experience past lives. And as I
        have already mentioned, the magickal work you are doing will probably trigger at one time or another a past-life
        experience.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In this course our real interest is the Kabalistic theory of
        reincarnation. The Kabalah, remember, is not a static, unchanging theory, but an <span
          class="italic">evolving</span> metaphysical philosophy. The Kabalah has several theories of reincarnation,
        which have evolved over time. None, however, are as simplistic as W. W. Westcott, a founder of the Golden Dawn,
        expressed when he said that according to the Kabalah people are limited to three incarnations. This has been
        copied by some authors who were members of the Golden Dawn and by other writers who don’t give their sources
        credit. Before going on, I must add that in another work Westcott does talk about a more advanced Kabalistic
        theory of reincarnation. This is the Lurianic theory of metempsychosis, the Kabalistic theory of incarnating as
        a higher or lower life form.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There are two prime Kabalistic theories of reincarnation. The first
        relates to the Four Worlds. This theory sees four levels (relating to the Worlds), each of which has a series of
        lessons to be learned. If you do not learn them in one lifetime, you must reincarnate until you do. Once you
        have learned all of the lessons in the lowest level, becoming as spiritual as possible in the lowest World, in
        your next incarnation you will find yourself at the most unspiritual place of the next of the Four Worlds. As
        you may have guessed, the lessons and experiences are associated with the Tree of Life, and thus have ten basic
        areas of concern, although there may be many more subcategories. It can be seen that according to this system,
        there can be innumerable incarnations.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">According to this system, the goal is to traverse all Four Worlds and
        perfect yourself so that you can reunite with the Divine. However, it is claimed that most people only get to
        the Tiferet level of B’ri-yah. At this point a person has evolved to such a high state that further incarnations
        are no longer necessary for evolvement.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The second basic theory is the above-mentioned one of Isaac Luria.
        Luria was a famous Kabalist who never wrote anything, but whose students’ writings make him a father of modern
        Jewish Kabalism. His system has two basic features that would today be called metempsychosis and karma.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Metempsychosis, or the transmigration of souls, is the idea that we
        can incarnate as a lower life form if our current life is not in tune with the working of the universe. But the
        Lurianic theory goes much further than other theories of this type. In this system you are not punished for evil
        by becoming a cow. Rather, your next incarnation is dependent upon what you need to learn. Thus, if you need to
        learn stealth you might incarnate in your next life as a thief or as that thieving bird, the magpie. As you can
        see, the reason for incarnating into a “lower” life form is very logical.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The Lurianic system not only features this high level of logic, it
        also features greater depth. If you need to learn patience, for example, you may incarnate as a rock. If you
        need to learn flexibility you may come back as a reed by a river.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The ideas that come out of this are fascinating. The implication is
        that plants, rocks, and animals are alive and have souls. This also implies that all planets and asteroids are
        teeming with some form of life. In fact, it means that the entire universe is wonderfully alive, and that we are
        but a small part of it while at the same time intimately connected to all of it.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">According to this system, we stay in a “lower” form until we have
        learned the necessary lesson and we have been of some use to a “higher” life form. Thus, in the example given
        above, you could stay a rock until you learned patience and until you had become useful, perhaps by providing
        shade to a snake or an insect, or serving as a stool for a human hiker. It is possible that your stay as a stone
        could last a relatively short time, or it could last for thousands of years. Likewise, you might stay a reed
        until you learn flexibility and become the food of an animal or perhaps part of a reed boat. As a side note,
        Dion Fortune urges non-vegetarianism for Western occultists because giving up animal products in the diet may
        cause a psychic opening too quickly and bring about psychic or physical damage. Those who believe in the
        Lurianic theory of metempsychosis would argue that you should eat meat, as it will help those who have
        incarnated as animals move up the evolutionary scale. Others say you should avoid meat, as it brings down the
        frequency of your energy, preventing you from evolving as quickly as possible.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">To my mind, you should do what’s right for you. If you force yourself
        to do otherwise you will be uncomfortable and unhappy, which is a handicap for psychic development. If you don’t
        want to eat meat, don’t; if you want to eat meat, do.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The Lurianic system also features a notion of karma. In Hebrew it is
        called <span class="italic">tee-koon</span>. As mentioned earlier, in English and other Romance languages, words
        tend to have specific meanings. In Sanskrit, this is not so. In fact, some of the earliest works in Sanskrit,
        the Tantras, frequently use what is called <span class="italic">sandhya bhasa,</span> or “twilight language,”
        and are filled with hidden meanings that required a key to understand the twilight language code. Hebrew and
        other Semitic languages are similar in frequently having broad or imprecise meanings for words. Thus, although
        “tee-koon” means “correct” (as in “to make a correction”), it implies the restoring of the soul to its true
        identity. Therefore, the reason we reincarnate in other life forms is to correct errors we have made in previous
        lives. The reason we experience bad things in our lives for no apparent reason is for the working out of this
        tee-koon process. There is a passage in the Bible which says that God punishes a person for his sins unto the
        third generation. If you do not believe in reincarnation, this implies an incredibly vicious and vindictive
        deity. If, on the other hand, you believe that this is a type of twilight language and really means that you
        have to spend up to three incarnations to learn to “correct” past behavior, it becomes a reasonable and logical
        statement. Three lifetimes could easily be over 200 years, and that’s a long time to spend on correcting errors
        in your actions. This may also be the source of Westcott’s “three incarnations” error.</span></div>

          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The technique is actually very simple. Get a large piece of

            <div class="calibre19">Place this on an easel or some sort of stand with a chair in front of it so that when

          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">After a surprisingly short time, you should begin to see a glow
              around the head of the person sitting in the chair. Typically, it is grey, silver, white, or golden. This
              is the opening of your astral vision so you can see the aura. After a while, that glow should start to
              show colors typically described in auras. It may take several sessions for you to see the colors. Be sure
              to do this with different persons, as you may be able to see colors more easily with one person than
              another.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Bring your attention back to the face of the person in the
              chair. Once you have begun to see the aura, it is likely that you will soon begin to see the face alter

              changes, and different clothes. These may be visual clues into that person’s past lives.</span></div>

          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It may help to use peripheral vision rather than focused or

              you can. This is sometimes referred to as “soft” vision. Back in the late twentieth century, there were
              complex pictures that seemed to be a swirl of lines. However, if you softened your vision in this way, an
              image of a horse or a space ship in 3D would seem to leap out at you. This is the type of vision you

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Let us assume that you have gone through many, many lifetimes and have
        achieved as much spiritual perfection as is possible for a person to achieve. You have been corrected. What,
        then, is the result? To answer this question we must first answer the question of where souls come from.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Simply, the Divine created all of the souls before their first
        incarnation. Thus, unrecognized, we are all imperfect parts of the Divine Source of all. Many have not
        incarnated as yet. It is possible that some may never do so. These proto-human souls are referred to as “sparks”
        in Kabalistic literature. These sparks are androgynous. When the soul is ready to incarnate, it is split in two.
        Each half will go to a member of a different gender. Each “soul half” watches over the forming fetus, but does
        not join with it until the first breath is taken. Also, note that according to this system you do not start as a
        lower life form and work your way up. Rather, you start as a human and can work yourself up or down.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Once you have achieved as spiritual a state as possible in each
        lifetime, the next step in the tee-koon process is for you to find the other half of your soul. The other half
        will also have gone through a series of experiences and will be waiting to join with you. It may be that one of
        you achieves the state of being ready to re-unify sooner than the other and will have to wait several lifetimes
        for the arrival of the missing half. When the time is right, you will be united with your “soul mate.” This is
        the Kabalistic understanding of the term. In the interim you should love, marry, and have children. When the
        time is right, your true soul mate will appear, will be about your current age, will be of the opposite gender,
        and will not be a blood relative. (And please do not swallow the “Hey, baby. Don’t you know I’m your soul mate?”
        line. Anyone who says it, isn’t.) This obviously is in contrast to the theory popular among some that we have
        many soul mates.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Once you meet and unite with your soul mate, your divided soul will
        also unify during the time you spend together. This uniting is especially important during sex; however, that is
        a topic to be discussed later in these lessons. Once your soul is back in one piece as a result of the tee-koon
        process, you are fit to reunite with your creator . . .</span></div>

    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">I am often amazed at the incompetence of people claiming to be
        ceremonial magicians. Many of those whom I have met seem to think that the LBRP is the highest level of ritual
        magick, then wonder why Pagans criticize them for their “complicated rituals.” In fact, some self-described
        magicians drop the “Lesser” so that the LBRP becomes <span class="italic">THE</span> Banishing Ritual of the
        Pentagram. This is totally wrong and totally in error. The LBRP was given to the members of the Golden Dawn
        (remember, they were a non-magickal group) to prepare them for the magickal work to come in the Inner Order of
        that organization. It is hoped that by this time you have been practicing the LBRP for several months. Time will
        not wait, and it is important that you are fully competent with the LBRP so that you can start practicing the
        following rite, the Supreme Invoking Ritual of the Pentagram.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As you probably remember, the points of the pentagram represent the
        five magickal elements: Spirit at the top, then, going counterclockwise, Air, Earth, Fire, and Water (see
        diagram on the next page).</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In the LBRP you will note that since we start from the lower left we
        are moving <span class="italic">away</span> from the point of the pentagram association with elemental Earth.
        Had we moved from the top <span class="italic">toward</span> the lower left corner when making the first line,
        we would be performing the Lesser <span class="italic">Invoking</span> Ritual of the Pentagram. Some people
        advise doing the invoking in the morning and the banishing in the evening. In fact, I used to teach this.
        However, I now do not believe this is effective, as it prevents rapid and thorough learning of the LBRP. I now
        believe that the banishing <span class="italic">must</span> be learned and effective first. <span
          class="italic">Being able to do the LBRP effectively is a prerequisite for the rest of this course.</span>
        After a person has become completely effective with the LBRP he or she might wish to do the Lesser Invoking
        Ritual of the Pentagram (LIRP) in the morning and the LBRP at night. By the time they have achieved excellence
        with the LBRP they should have been doing enough other work in their magickal training that they can deal with
        any unexpected energies literally invited in during the day by the use of the LIRP.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre2"><img alt="088" src="images/000146.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There are also four pentagrams associated with the element of Spirit.
        Instead of invoking, two are called “equilibrating.” Instead of banishing, two are called “closing.” Both
        Equilibrating and Closing are divided into active and passive, giving a total of four, as shown in the first
        diagram on the next page.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Along with the four pentagrams of Spirit, there are also eight
        pentagrams, two for each of the other elements. Each element has a banishing and invoking pentagram, as shown in
        the second diagram on the next page.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The Supreme Invoking Ritual of the Pentagram is a more powerful
        version of the Lesser Invoking Ritual of the Pentagram. As you can guess, it can become the Supreme Banishing
        Ritual of the Pentagram by using the banishing forms of the pentagrams instead of the invoking ones. However,
        the purpose of this ritual at this time in our work is to bring <span class="italic">into</span> our lives the
        forces of all the elements. Later, it will take on even more importance.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">At this time, practice this ritual <span class="italic">only in the
          morning</span> . When doing this work, at this time in the course, always follow it with the LBRP. Do not
        perform the Supreme Invoking Ritual of the Pentagram (SIRP) in the evening. This is not because the SIRP is
        dangerous, but because it can be very invigorating and might cause you difficulty in falling asleep. This is
        especially true when you are in the learning process and have not perfected the ritual.</span></div>

      <div class="calibre19">Two other things need to be noted here. First, in the center of each of the pentagrams are

        This should be done so that the last syllable (pey) is sounding after you finish drawing the pentagram. As in
        the LBRP, inhale, feeling energy come into you, but exhale as you make the pentagram. Be sure to save enough
        breath so that you can thrust your hands forward into the center of the while you vibrate the last syllable

        blue and the lines connecting them are white. The Wheels of Spirit should also be the same brilliant, pure white
        light as the lines connecting the pentagrams. The Aquarius sign should be yellow to represent Air. The Leo sigil
        should be red for Fire. The Eagle symbol should be blue to represent elemental Water. Finally, the Taurus sign
        should be shiny black to represent Earth.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If you were doing this ritual in the form of a banishing ritual you
        would use the same symbols within the pentagrams. However, the pentagrams would use their banishing forms while
        the Spirit pentagrams would use their closing forms.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">You may notice that I did not mention a particular tool to use in this
        ritual. At this time, use the dagger. However, as we progress in this course, you will find that one particular
        weapon is not associated with this ritual as the dagger is with the LBRP.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Of course, conclude the ritual by recording what you did and what you
        experienced in your ritual diary.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">On the following page you will find a summary for this ritual. The
        SIRP should be learned, and preferably memorized, but it is not a part of your daily work. While you are
        learning it, you might want to make a copy of the following page and carry it with you. If you need more
        information, or if it is more convenient, while you are learning it copy it onto filing cards. As they are made
        of cardboard, rather than paper, they are more stable and easier to handle. Some people like to use the typical
        3 x 5 inch cards, however I always found those to be too small. Instead, I preferred 4 x 6 inch cards. They’re
        not that much bigger but have surprisingly more space. As always, however, if you want to use something like
        cards, try different sizes and see which works the best for you.</span></div>

        </span></span></h1>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">I want to return now to a further look at the Kabalistic Four Worlds.
        These Four Worlds represent four planes or levels of existence. In English we could say that these four planes
        are the physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The physical plane relates to the lowest world of Ahssiah; the
        emotional plane is associated with Yetzirah; the mental level equates with the world of B’ri-yah; and the
        spiritual plane is related to the world known as Atziloot. You might wish to reread the section on the Four
        Worlds from an earlier lesson at this time.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There are other systems that claim that there are far more planes of
        existence. Many systems hold that there are seven planes. Others hold that there are thirty-three or more
        planes. Some believe that there is only one other plane, and the philosophy known as materialism claims that
        there is only the physical reality we know in our everyday existence and nothing more. Soon we will be studying
        Grey Magick, and although the practice of White Magick necessitates the knowledge of all of the Kabalistic
        Worlds (especially the spiritual world of Atziloot), in Grey Magick there is really only one plane other than
        the physical plane that is of interest. This is the emotional plane, the Kabalistic world of Yetzirah.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As you should recall, Yetzirah is also considered to be the so-called
        “astral plane.” As I said in the lesson discussing the Four Worlds, Yetzirah, the astral plane, is “the basis
        for everything that exists in the physical universe.” You may have passed over this quotation, ignoring it, or
        you may have wondered what was meant by the claim that the astral plane was the basis for everything in the
        physical universe, including, of course, all people and things in our world. This gives me another chance to
        urge you to go back occasionnally and review past lessons.Each time you read them you will get more out of them.
        They should not merely be read and forgotten. If you had really thought about it, you might have realized that
        the quotation from that earlier lesson may be the most important thing you will ever read. In fact, it may
        indicate a turning point in your life.</span></div>

          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I also included variations on the tradition and stressed two
              things. First, merely repeating what others had done wasn’t magick, it was hero worship. Second, this is a
              tradition, and traditions must evolve. If they do not, they become antiquated and obsolete. Magick is a
              living, breathing, experimental science, not ancient laws carved in stone never to be tampered with. The
              tradition is a tradition, however, because is has worked for so many people.</span></div>

              the important thing about magick was that you did it, not that it did anything. I responded to him that if
              that were true there would be no reason to do magick. I preferred the comment in Crowley’s <span
                class="italic">Book of the Law</span>: “Success is your proof.” He replied that I just didn’t get it and
              wouldn’t respond to me after that.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Maybe I didn’t get it, but the magickal tradition I know is
              focused around what is successful and practical, not doing something that has no results.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The thing is, I’m just one person. What works for me may not
              work for everyone. But what works for you might work for someone else. When I was teaching a regular
              series of classes, as opposed to individual workshops as I mostly do now, there was more time for people
              to share their experiences.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I love to hear what others are doing! They share ideas that I
              had never thought of. They add different things and twists that add to their effectiveness. Earlier in
              this course I suggested that everyone paint a set of Trees of Life, each one in the colors from a
              different Kabalistic scale. I used to assign that task to my class students. Every one that was turned in
              was different, but they all followed the scales. It was their interpretation, and sharing them allowed
              people to see that they can follow the tradition but still have independence and individuality. I think
              this is an important lesson to learn.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">But when the first edition of <span class="italic">Modern
                Magick</span> was published, there was no way to share all of the variations within the tradition. So I
              didn’t mention anything about it. Now, however, there is a way for each person to share what they’ve
              learned. It’s one of the most powerful and most magickal tools ever created. Of course, I mean the
              Internet.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I encourage you to start your own web page or website. Share
              your experiences, your tools, your drawings, your adventures. Or, you can do this on one of the social
              networking websites that are available. When I shared everyone’s Trees, I didn’t do so with the attitude
              of one being wrong and another right. Rather, I wanted to show that variation and originality is possible.
              I hope you approach this in the same light. Share what you have done not to claim that others are wrong
              but that there can be power in diversity.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">That way, by the simple act of sharing, you’ll be helping
              magickal people everywhere.</span></div>

    </div>
    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This quotation tells, in a simple manner, the basis of all Grey
        Magick. But to fully understand the importance and meaning of it we have to start by looking again at
        reincarnation. However, this time we will approach it from a different angle. We need to look at the question we
        have all asked at one time or another: “Where did I come from?”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Quite obviously, the human being is more than just flesh, bone, and
        blood. There is also an energy, which animates the body. As already stated, in the Kabalah this energy is known
        as Ruach. But merely having a piece of meat that is animated by Ruach does not make a human being. The thing
        that really makes you different from other pieces of animated meat is your personality and what is commonly
        called your “soul.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The soul and personality are not the same. Rather, the personality
        relates to your ego, or that aspect of the personality known in the Kabalah as the Ruach (not to be confused
        with the animating energy of the same name). The soul, in Freudian terms, is the superego; in Kabalistic terms
        it is the Yeh-chee-dah, your higher self. (Yeah, I know this gets complex and even confusing. Read it a few
        times and think about it. Make notes. If it still doesn’t make sense, just drop it for a week or two. When you
        come back to it you’ll find a new awareness and confidence as it becomes clear.)</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">According to the Kabalah, when you die, the body immediately starts to
        decay and should go into “Shee-ool.” As an interesting side note, Shee-ool is usually translated when it appears
        in the <span class="italic">Tanach</span> or Jewish Bible as “ground” or “earth.” However, in some instances
        (when the translators wished to convey the idea that if you are a “sinner” when you die you will be punished),
        the same word is translated as “Hell.” The Kabalah does not have any such place of eternal punishment. According
        to both the Kabalah and an accurate translation of the <span class="italic">Tanach</span>, there is no
        Hell.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The Kabalistic tradition says that when you go through the change
        known as death the personality (ego or Ruach) does not realize exactly what has occurred. This is especially
        true in cases of sudden or traumatic death. The personality of the dead person, suddenly freed from the physical
        body, tends to wander back and forth between the body (in Shee-ool, the grave) and the previous home of the
        person for a period of seven days. Traditionally, Jews stay in their home for a week after the death of a member
        of the household. In Hebrew, the word for the number seven is <span class="italic">sheevah</span>, and this
        practice is commonly known as “sitting sheevah.” Mirrors are covered so the returning spirit won’t be shocked at
        seeing themselves in a dead state.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">What most modern Jews who follow this practice do not know is the
        purpose of this ritual. The purpose is the same as the purpose of such books as the Egyptian and Tibetan Books
        of the Dead: to tell the personality that it has gone through the change known as death and that it is free to
        move on. It is probable that there may be a lost Hebrew text similar in nature to the Books of the Dead. If so,
        it was probably lost along with most of the texts concerning Merkabah mysticism.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">According to the Kabalistic tradition, after about one week the
        personality begins to realize what has happened and eventually dissolves to nothingness (remember, it is
        mortal). However, people with extremely strong personalities can will themselves to stay in a shadowy world of
        semi-existence. This may be one of the causes of what is commonly known as hauntings.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It is not advisable to allow or aid the Ruach-ego to exist for long
        periods after physical death. This is because there are important links between the Ruach-ego and the
        Yeh-chee-dah. By keeping the Ruach-ego locked to the physical world, it prevents the Yeh-chee-dah from
        reincarnating and eventually achieving its far more lofty goal of unity with the Divine. Thus it is that the
        Kabalists usually frown upon spiritism and spiritualistic practices. Communicating with our deceased loved ones
        (if that’s who it is we really are communicating with) tends to lock the Ruach-ego near the physical plane. It
        prevents necessary evolution.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As I stated earlier, your Yeh-chee-dah is your link to the Divine.
        Actually, it is more than that: it is literally a small part of God. That is why it is said we were made in the
        likeness of Divinity. The Divine is a part of us. God is not a big old man with a beard, sitting on a throne
        that is on a cloud.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">But for some reason unknowable to our mortal minds, most of humanity
        has lost the conscious awareness of that link. In order to re-establish the fact that there is a part of us that
        is of the Divine, we must evolve our consciousnesses. This, along with the working out of karma (Tee-koon), is
        the purpose of reincarnation.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As stated in an earlier lesson, our memories, like the Ruach-ego, are
        mortal, and most of them die with our physical bodies. But the important things, the lessons we need to learn so
        that we can again become not just linked with Divinity (Yoga) but actually rejoin the Godhead, are remembered.
        Unfortunately, one lifetime is usually not enough to learn all of the lessons necessary so that we can become
        one with the Godhead and need no longer incarnate. Each lifetime on Earth is necessary to learn either one or
        more lessons. If you do not learn them in this lifetime, then when you reincarnate you will still need to learn
        them.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">Sometimes we are shown the lesson we need to learn but end up flunking the course. Then,
        after retaking the lesson we flunk it again! As a certified Tarot Grandmaster, a reader of Tarot cards, I used
        to frequently work at psychic fairs. Usually at least once at each fair a young woman, frequently with a baby,
        would tell me a story like this:<div class="calibre20">
          <blockquote class="calibre21">
            <div class="calibre19">
              <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">“When I started living with______, he was very good to me.
                  We have two wonderful children. But after a few years he started drinking, running around with other
                  women, and beating me and the kids. Well, I took this for three years. Then, I finally picked up the
                  kids, moved out, and got a job. About six months later I met a really nice guy. He moved in with the
                  kids and me. But recently he has started drinking, running around with other women, and hitting me and
                  the kids. What can I do to make him nice again?”</span></div>

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Of course, there are similar situations with men, only they usually
        tend to allow themselves to be manipulated until they can no longer take the ego bruising rather than being
        physically abused. Sometimes, people will tell me the same story has happened to them four or five times.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">For the woman above, there are many lessons to be learned. Usually
        such a situation is based upon feelings of lack of worth and the need to develop self-respect, and to treat
        yourself well. Another lesson illustrated in the above example is to learn what attracts you to these bad
        situations, and what attracts bad people to you. There are many variations in the exact story, and each reveals
        more lessons which can be learned.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn advised you to seek your Holy
        Guardian Angel and find out the lessons you need to learn so you will not have to learn them again in this or a
        future lifetime. This brings us (finally) to how you were born.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Obviously, the meeting of the sperm and ovum both produces the
        physical body and, in most cases where birth is the end result, instills the zygote with Ruach energy. But where
        does the soul, the real and eternal you, come from?</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Since your soul has a direct link to the Godhead, it is obvious that
        your soul must also have a link to the total knowledge of the all-knowing deity. After the ego ceases to be, the
        soul is freed from bondage to the ego. It can freely learn through that link to the Divinity and discover
        exactly what it will need to learn in its next incarnation in order to evolve to that desired state where
        incarnation will no longer be necessary. Then, not being bound by the physical laws of time and space, your
        future soul searches for a “house,” a body to inhabit, which will allow it to actually learn the necessary
        lessons.</span></div>

                Happened to the Old Testament?</span></span></div>
          <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
          <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">If you read the first or second editions of <span
                class="italic">Modern Magick</span>, you may be surprised to see that in this edition I do not use the
              term “Old Testament.” There is an important reason for this.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The Jewish Bible is composed of several parts or books. The most
              famous section, of course, is the first five books known as the Torah. If you go to a synagogue and see
              the Torah scrolls brought out, the writings there are the first five books of the Bible and not the entire
              holy scriptures. To Jews, the technical name for the entire Bible is the <span
                class="italic">Tanach</span>.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">To religious Jews, the <span class="italic">Tanach</span> is the
              lifeblood of Judaism. But Christians refer to it as the “Old Testament,” replaced by their wonderful “New
              Testament.” The use of those terms is so commonplace that even Jews now refer to the <span
                class="italic">Tanach</span> as the “Old Testament.”</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">But to Jews, the <span class="italic">Tanach</span> is a
              spiritual document. It is neither old nor obsolete. They need no “New Testament” and find their religion
              quite enough, thank you!</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">To call the <span class="italic">Tanach</span>, the holy book of
              the Jews, “Old” is to denigrate what’s in it, Jewish beliefs, and Jews themselves. It is basically an
              anti-Semitic term. Yes, I used it previously. But we all grow and develop and understand more as we
              evolve. So in these lessons, and for me personally, it’s <span class="italic">Tanach</span> and not the
              “Old Testament.”</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Some people may claim I’m just being “politically correct” with
              this change. I would respectfully disagree. I choose not to be anti-Semitic and I choose to be accurate.
              If that’s being “PC,” so be it. It’s not my intention to offend any particular group of people, although I
              realize that some people are going to be offended by the very publication of this course.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">According to the Kabalah, the soul joins with the chosen human body
        when that body takes its first breath, and not before. However, it will watch over and help protect the forming
        fetus. It may only take hours for the soul to find the appropriate body, but it might take years.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">When a woman and man are making love they set up a vortex of energy,
        which attracts souls waiting to incarnate. If the act of sexual intercourse is done spiritually and with love,
        it will attract a soul needing a nurturing family and be able to develop spiritually. If the “love” act is done
        with hatred and anger, a soul needing that type of treatment will be attracted. Is it any wonder that most of
        the people who physically abuse their children were themselves abused as a child? Is it any wonder that most of
        the people in prison for serious felonies were abused children? This does not mean that a childhood of abuse
        necessitates a violent life. In fact, it may be that a person needs to learn to overcome violent behavior and
        incarnates into a situation where he or she learns violence so that it can be overcome. By the way, an
        interesting Kabalistic tradition holds that sometimes several souls will actually argue over trying to get into
        a particular body.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As mentioned before, your soul, or let us say “soul consciousness,”
        descends in superiority and becomes secondary to your emerging ego and personality. In fact, that soul
        consciousness descends so far that it becomes what is known as your unconscious.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Thus, it is your unconscious that is your link to Divinity. This is
        why true meditation, which reverses this order and makes the unconscious once again dominant (not the
        superficial layers of the unconscious as represented by the Freudian id, but the real “soul consciousness”),
        allows you to know the link between yourself and the Godhead and use that link to all wisdom and all knowledge.
        It allows you to obtain answers to seemingly insoluble problems. Furthermore, this deep level of your
        unconscious, your true “soul consciousness,” exists on what is called the astral plane: the Kabalistic world of
        Yetzirah. If you had been born with another soul, you would not be the same person. The part of you which exists
        in the Yetziratic world, the astral plane, was in existence before your physical body.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In fact, everything that exists in our physical plane, the Kabalistic
        world of Ahssiah, has an astral or Yetziratic counterpart. This counterpart is usually known as the astral body.
        Every person has an astral body or astral double. So does every animal, vegetable, or mineral. Everything has a
        pre-existing astral double. You do not have an astral body because you have a physical body. Rather, you have a
        physical body because the astral body already existed and wanted to join a new “home.” While your soul was
        waiting to inhabit its physical body with the body’s first breath, it was establishing a link between itself and
        the physical body. This link is the astral body. <span class="italic">For anything to exist on the physical
          plane it must first exist on the Astral Plane!</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Therefore, in order to create anything and bring it into your life,
        all you have to do is create it in the astral plane. This is the underlying principle of all Grey Magick. The
        reason why there are so many different types of Grey Magick is because there are many ways of creating things in
        the astral plane. Soon, you will be learning a few of them.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">At this point in the course, if you have not done so already, I want
        to urge you to pause and study, at least briefly, a book by another author. It should be about any of the
        subjects of this course. A true magician does not blindly follow the words of others. He or she is a scientist
        and investigates any and all possible avenues. A magician is not locked into any form of dogma or conditioning.
        This is why a magician is a dangerous person. A true magician does not buy the semi-truths and lies told by
        religious and civic leaders to keep the masses in tow and in fear. A magician is always free, and freedom always
        frightens totalitarians.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">In the next few pages I am going to be discussing a very important
        part of your magickal training: physical fitness and health. Now before you skip this section totally, let me
        explain that I am most definitely not talking about hours of arduous exercises with weights until you look like
        a stand-in for Arnold Schwarzenegger! What I will be talking about here is quite different.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">First, let us look at the idea of health. What exactly is health? If
        you ask an M.D., he or she will tell you things about vital signs, blood pressure, cholesterol and triglyceride
        levels, etc. But what is really being talked about is not health. Rather these are indications of what
        constitutes both a lack of disease and disease prevention. You could be without disease in Western medical terms
        but still not be vibrant and full of health.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre2"><img alt="104" src="images/000147.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre12"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">Levels of Health</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre13">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The diagram above shows that although you could be above the point
        where a disease manifests (Point 1), you could still be below a really healthy condition. Some people get to
        Point 1, just above the disease line, so that no disease is manifesting. But just a tiny change in conditions
        could result in slipping below the line and coming down with, perhaps, a cold or flu, or possibly something more
        severe.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Do you know anybody who seems to be coming down with a cold every few
        weeks or months? It is because they only improve their health to Point 1. If, on the other hand, your health
        stays above the health line (Point 2), minor changes will have little effect upon your health. It will take a
        major change for you to fall all of the way down to below the disease line, where you leave yourself open for
        illness. It should be obvious, then, that we would want to achieve a state of high-level health. This is
        especially true for magicians who may have to spend tiring hours in a magickal circle where the temperature can
        make sudden and radical jumps. (Yes, I know we haven’t done anything like that yet, but we will!)</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Ask your doctor what signs of health are and you get responses which
        show what disease isn’t. What, then, are the signs of health?</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In the West, we really do not at this time have a good definition,
        although holistic health practitioners are working on establishing them. That simply hasn’t been the focus of
        Western medicine. For now, to answer this question, we turn to traditional Chinese medicine.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">According to my Shiatzu teacher, Dr. Turk, the ancient Chinese
        believed that there were eight signs of health. The goal of the physician was to maximize these signs in his or
        her patients:</span></div>

        them, but you may wish to aim for them.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">For the purposes of these lessons, we are only concerned with the
        first quality, vitality. This includes physical vitality and vitality of the energies of the body. For this I
        need to tell you about a strange manuscript known as <span class="italic">The Eye of Revelation.</span></span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I had heard about this mysterious manuscript for quite some time and
        had been looking for it for several years. Today it is well-known and a cottage industry seems to have grown up
        around it, but when I first researched it, information was rare.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The exercises in that document are known as the “Five Tibetan Rites”
        (or sometimes just the “Five Tibetans”) and had been passed along in a sort of occultists’ underground for a
        long time. I knew the rites, but I wanted to find a copy of the original text. Finally, a first edition of it
        fell into my hands. This small book was written by a man named Peter Kelder and had a copyright date of 1939. It
        tells the story of an elderly man who visits a lamasery in India and learns some magickal rites (which are more
        like physical exercises). These rites rejuvenate him to such a degree that he is mistaken for his son.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Quite frankly, I doubt that this story as presented is true because
        there are many things in it which sound as if they were made up. Further, I more recently found another small
        book, also with a copyright of 1939, that is even more rare. It is by a man named Emile Raux, titled <span
          class="italic">Hindu Secrets of Virility and Rejuvenation</span>. It is practically the same information
        without the questionable story attached to it. I’ve checked with some authorities, but nobody will state which
        came first. My guess is that it was the Raux book, as it includes photographs while the Kelder book only has
        drawings, and the rites do have some similarities to certain forms of Indian hatha yoga. Besides, to the best of
        my knowledge, no Tibetans have ever acknowledged the rites as being part of any Tibetan practice, although one
        lama has claimed they are an authentic part of an Indo-Tibetan Tantric tradition.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Whatever the source, no matter the debate over the veracity of the
        story attached to the exercises, I know of nothing that can deny the success so many people have had toward
        improving their health as a result of practicing the Five Rites. It works not only on the physical body, but
        also on the non-physical energetic system. The instructions for the Five Rites are on the following
        pages.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As with any exercise program, you should consult an M.D. first and
        tell him or her that you wish to begin exercising. This is especially true if you have not exercised in a long
        time or if you are considerably out of shape. You should never strain with these exercises, although you may
        perspire. Only do as many as you can and advance gradually. Never force anything.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">One of the problems with Westerners is the curse of perfectionism. We
        want everything to be totally perfect. If it is not perfect, then we don’t want it at all. In the case of these
        exercises or rites, do the best job with them that you can. But if you cannot do a rite even one time well, do
        it one time poorly. Just do it.</span></div>

          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There’s another part of this that is important to understand.
              When you say you’re going to do something and succeed at it, your unconscious mind carries that over into
              all levels of your life. “I’m a success” it thinks, and then it literally drives you to success in all
              areas. Similarly, if you fail at one thing, your mind carries the “I’m a failure” focus into other areas
              of your life. People who fail at one thing tend to fail at others, too.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Now obviously, you’re a bright person (you bought this course,
              didn’t you?) so you want to bring success to all aspects of your life. A key to that is making appropriate
              and attainable goals (more on that later in this course). However, an easy way to become a success is to
              simply lower your expectations.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Since we’re about to discuss health, let’s say you decide to go
              to the gym. Maybe you’ve made a New Year’s Resolution of “I’m going to go to the gym five days every
              week.” You probably know people who have done that. My guess is that most, if not all, have eventually
              failed and given up. Many gyms work on the assumption that most people who sign up will stop attending
              within a few months, but keep paying “dues.”</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Let’s look at what happens. Well, life happens. Something comes
              up and before long you’ve missed a day. You only went four times that week. Well, as a failure, you may as
              well give up. That’s the way most people think.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">So let’s turn it around. Change the goal to a minimum of twice a
              week. You start out going five times a week. You’re not only a success, but you’ve exceeded your goal. And
              success feels really good.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Then a problem happens and you’re only able to go to the gym
              three times a week. You’re still an amazing success, exceeding your goals. That’s better living through
              lowered expectations!</span></div>

      </blockquote>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The Five Rites should be done once a day, every day, skipping no more
        than one day a week. If you are setting goals for yourself and can’t quite do all the desired repetitions of one
        particular exercise, do the unfinished number of repetitions later in the day. The full set of exercises should
        take no more than ten minutes per day once they are learned.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">When doing the rites, remember to breathe! You should exhale whenever
        your body goes through a contracting part of the exercise and inhale at a stretching or relaxation section. Try
        not to pant.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As a last thought, many people who become involved with ceremonial
        magick become disappointed rather quickly, because they find that due to a lack of knowledge or talent they are
        unable to do magick quickly. Or, they find that there is a great deal of study, practice, and work, which will
        take more time than they wish to dedicate. I think that most people have bizarre expectations as to what magick
        really is because of the silliness seen in movies and on television. It is also due to the lies fostered by
        fearful religious and pseudo-occult groups. Some people expect that if you wear a black robe, say a few weird
        words, and wave your hand in the air, you can do magick. As those of you reading this lesson know, nothing could
        be further from the truth.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In getting this far in the course you have persevered on the path of
        magick and occultism when many who have come before you have faltered, failed, or given up. You should
        congratulate yourself.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The next lesson will be the last to focus on White Magick. Starting in
        the seventh lesson we will be going into the techniques and practices of Grey Magick. These methods will allow
        you to make positive changes in your life and the lives of those around you.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">What you have been practicing in these five lessons and in the next
        lesson are specifically arranged to prepare you to do Grey Magick. If you are not competent at doing the rituals
        given in these lessons, you will have great difficulty succeeding with Grey Magick. This does not mean that the
        thousands of people who have practiced Grey Magick over the centuries have been fooled because “it doesn’t
        work.” Rather, it means that you need more preparation. And practice!</span></div>

    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">Rite Number One.</span> This is the simplest of the
        rites, but do not discount its importance. Stand upright with your hands straight out to the sides. Now spin
        around in a clockwise direction (from left to right) until you become slightly dizzy. When you first try this
        you may only be able to make three to six turns, but within ten weeks you should be up to twenty-one circles,
        which is the maximum you need to do.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre2"><img alt="106" src="images/000078.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">Rite Number Two.</span> In this exercise you lie
        down, feet together, on a flat surface. Your hands should be palms down with the fingers together, but slightly
        turned in toward the center of the body (see illustration above). Raise the legs off the floor so that they are
        straight up, or, better yet, until they are slightly past center. At the same time touch the chin to the chest.
        Then slowly lower the legs and head and relax. Do this as many times as possible, but don’t strain. Your goal is
        to get up to twenty-one repetitions. Don’t bend the knees, but if you cannot do even one repetition, see how
        many you can do with your knees bent.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre2"><img alt="107" src="images/000121.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">Rite Number Three.</span> This rite should be done
        immediately after doing the second rite. Simply kneel on a flat surface with your hands by your sides, palms in.
        Lean forward as far as you can without losing your balance. Be sure to touch your chin to your chest. Then lean
        backward as far as you can, allowing your head to fall back. Repeat this as many times as you can, your goal
        being twenty-one repetitions.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre2"><img alt="108" src="images/000034.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">Rite Number Four.</span> Sit on a flat surface with
        your arms down at your sides so that the palms are flat on the ground. Now raise the body and bend the knees so
        that your torso becomes like a table to the supports of your arms and legs. Before pushing up, your chin should
        touch your chest. As you move up, your head should be allowed to gently move back (see illustration). Return to
        original position. As with the other rites, your goal is twenty-one times.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre2"><img alt="109" src="images/000159.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">Rite Number Five.</span> Lie face down on the floor
        with the arms about two feet apart. Your legs should also be about two feet apart. Push the body, especially the
        hips, straight up as high as possible. Touch your chin to your chest. Now allow the body to come down to a
        sagging position with the head thrown back. Ideally you should not touch the ground, but if you must that is
        okay. Again, twenty-one repetitions is your goal. As with all of the other rites, allow yourself ten weeks to
        reach this goal.</span></div>

        <span class="bold1">The Fire Element</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">In the last three lessons we have been examining the archetypal
        magickal elements. In this lesson we will continue the pattern by studying the last of the four elements, Fire.
        I remind you that there is a fifth element, Spirit. The reason it is not discussed in the same way as the other
        elements is because it is the source of the four archetypal elements. The way to come to know Spirit is by a
        thorough knowledge and understanding of Air, Earth, Fire, and Water. The element Spirit is nothing less than the
        Spirit (Ruach, energy, or Shakti) of Divinity. It is only through those manifestations of Divinity of which the
        Godhead wishes us to become aware that we can come to know the ultimate deity. The infinitude of the Divine
        Source of All is beyond the comprehension of our finite minds, save the ways in which the Godhead chooses to be
        revealed to us.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">According to the <span class="italic">Sepher Yetzirah</span>, Air
        emanated from Spirit, Primitive Water emanated from Air, and Fire emanated from Water. Earth comes from a
        division of the Primitive Water into Water and Earth, although some say it is a combination of the other three
        elements.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If you are not satisfied with your familiarity with any of the three
        previous elements, continue to work on the exercises for those elements for another week or two, and then as you
        will. But be sure to begin the exercises for Fire immediately.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre20">

        <div class="calibre19">
          <div class="calibre12"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">The element of Fire has the qualities of
                being warm and dry</span>.</span></div>
        </div>
      </blockquote>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The following exercises will help you to become more aware of this
        magickal element in your daily life.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">EXERCISE 1</span>. Observe those things around
        you that have the combined qualities of heat and dryness. Compare the heat and dryness of a fire to that of the
        Sun. Interestingly, the burning core of the Sun is frequently referred to as “plasma” and is spoken of in terms
        resembling the way water would be described (such as flowing). Steam has more Fire than does ordinary water.
        Ordinary water has more Fire in it than does ice. Thus, to a degree, fire and water can coexist. Yet, they are
        considered to be total opposites, and should be able to cancel each other out. How can they exist together when
        they should destroy each other? The answer is in the percentage of each. Much water destroys a little fire, and
        vice versa. But even a small amount of fire changes water and a small amount of water also has some effect on
        fire. Try to observe fire in its various combinations with the other elements around you. Keep a record of this
        in your magickal diary. Do this exercise daily for at least one week.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">EXERCISE 2</span>. Find a place that is extremely
        hot, such as a desert or dry sauna (<span class="italic">not</span> a steam bath). If those are not possible,
        find a place where a roaring fire is going. Such a fire could be in a fireplace or a barbecue pit or grill.
        Remove all of your clothes (or as much of your clothes as is reasonable&mdash;and legal) and get as close to the
        heat source as possible without risking a burn. If you are in the desert, make sure that you have a sunscreen
        with a very high SPF level. Put an even higher SPF-rated sunscreen or protective clothing on any sensitive parts
        of the body that are exposed. This is especially true for the genitals and, if you are a woman, the breasts.
        These areas can become extremely painful and hypersensitive if sunburned. This must be avoided.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Once you are in a situation where it is uncomfortably hot (but not
        painfully or unbearably so) and your perspiration is freely flowing, do the Relaxation Ritual. This may be
        difficult due to the heat, but it will test you to see how well you can do this ritual. Then focus on your
        breathing and feel the heat-laden air going in and out of your lungs.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As before, imagine your entire body is nothing more than an enormous
        breathing apparatus. Imagine that every part of your body only has the function of breathing and nothing else.
        <span class="italic">Know</span> that your skin is a vital part of this system. As you physically breathe in
        air, imagine that every pore in your body’s skin is also breathing in heat and dryness: elemental Fire. Feel the
        Fire course through your body, cleansing and purifying. Then, as you exhale, feel it leave through your pores,
        taking with it the body’s toxins, pains, and sufferings. Repeat the pore breathing until you have mastered
        it.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Caution</span>: Only do this exercise next to a
        real fire or in a place like a desert once. Do not, under any circumstances, spend longer than ten minutes doing
        this exercise in real heat. When doing this type of work it is all too likely that you may lose your sense of
        time. Have an alarm set to sound after ten minutes or have a friend come and pull you out of the heat. <span
          class="italic">Immediately</span> drink one or two large glasses of cool (not cold) water. Get out of or away
        from the heat. If you have physical problems dealing with heat, consult an M.D. before doing this. This caution
        is for your health and safety, and neither the author nor the publisher will be responsible for your errors in
        this exercise.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Remember, the purpose of this exercise is to pore-breathe the magickal
        element of Fire. It is not to get you burned to a cinder. After you have done this exercise once next to or in a
        real heat source, you may repeat it by imagining the heat. Do this at different times of the day and at
        different locations. Try it in the cool of the night and even in a rain. If you start to perspire, you are being
        successful. Practice this for up to a week initially, then as you will.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">EXERCISE 3</span>. Spend a period of up to three
        minutes, once a day, imagining that <span class="italic">you are the element Fire</span>. Feel the heat and your
        ability to transmit that heat. If you have a regular lover, ask him or her if your kisses are “hotter” (more on
        this later). Feel the dryness and as a result, perhaps, stop your perspiration if you are perspiring. Know what
        Fire feels like, what Fire is. Practice this exercise for one week.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">EXERCISE 4</span>. Now that you have learned to
        “be Fire,” the next step is to learn how to consciously control this magickal element. Take a moment and again
        imagine yourself to be Fire. Bring the feelings you had in the last exercise into your awareness. Next, hold
        your hands nine to twelve inches apart with the palms facing each other. Visualize between your hands a bottle,
        cylinder, or small cask. Next, as you exhale, imagine all of the Fire element which is in you going out with
        your breath and being deposited in the container between your hands. Three to five times should be enough to
        fill it. If it gets too hot to “hold” between your hands, move your hands farther apart. Once it has been
        filled, simply observe it for a short space of time. Then, with three breaths, inhale it back into yourself and
        return to your normal consciousness. Spend about a week with this exercise.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">The Test</span>. Here is the simple self-test
        that will allow you to learn whether or not you have become not just in unison with the magickal element Fire,
        but also if you are its master. This test is to prove something to you, not to me or anyone else. If you do not
        pass the test, that is okay. It merely means that you need to do more work on the above exercises. Then you can
        take the test again. In fact, take the test as often as you wish. Just be sure to always record the results in
        your magickal diary.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The next time you feel as if you are bursting with an overload of
        energy, so much that it is hard to concentrate due to the fiery energy within you, try this: Form the container
        of fire as described in the previous exercise. Once you have done this, visualize a large “black hole” in the
        air in front of you. Now, “throw” the container of Fire into the black hole and then see the hole close so that
        nothing can return. Do this “black hole” three times. Your excess energy should be gone, but you should have
        enough energy left to do your necessary tasks<span class="italic">. Never do this black hole with Fire more than
          three times in one day</span>. Otherwise, you could become so drained that your physical body could be
        weakened. This could open you up to disease.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The next time you are feeling listless and have a total lack of energy
        (or for that matter, a lack of desire to do the necessary things in your life), form the Fire container, but
        this time inhale all of the contents of the container. Within a few minutes you should feel energized and
        revitalized. Try this instead of your morning cup of coffee. If you find that you have too much energy, black
        hole the excess as already described.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">When you have passed both parts of the test to your satisfaction, you
        will know that you are the master of the magickal element Fire. In fact, since this is the last of the four
        elements, once you pass this test and have passed the other three as well, you will be a master of the elements.
        To prove this to yourself, here are some suggestions to try.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre24">
      <div class="calibre25">
        <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">1. Sit in a room that has no air circulating. Light a
            candle and place it in the center of the room. Become one with the fire of the candle. Now, move the candle
            flame by your will, just as you might move your arm. For many people this is surprisingly easy.</span>
        </blockquote>
      </div>
      <div class="calibre25">
        <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">2. Become one with the moisture (Water) of a cloud. Now add
            Fire to it so that it expands in all directions. The cloud should disappear. White “fluffy” clouds of a
            smaller size when no dark clouds are visible tend to be the best for this experiment.</span></blockquote>
      </div>
      <div class="calibre25">
        <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">3. On a windy day, find a high spot such as a hill or the
            top of a tall building. Become one with Air until you can almost feel yourself going aloft. Then, start to
            bring some of the slowing power of Earth into you, and expand it into your environment. The wind should slow
            or cease in your area. Don’t try this for the first time during a hurricane! Try it with a light breeze.
            Later you might want to try a storm.</span></blockquote>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">You can probably come up with many more experiments to test your
        mastery of the magickal elements. Notice, however, that I am suggesting rather minor phenomena, not major
        changes in the environment. This is for two reasons. First, the test needs only to prove to you that you are
        capable of controlling the elements. Second, causing major changes in the environment is Grey Magick. To affect
        a large area means that you are interfering with the lives of other people as well as the plans of Mother
        Nature. You may want a dry day for your picnic and work to end a rain shower. To the farmer awaiting rain it
        could spell disaster and ruin the farmer’s livelihood. It might also increase the prices for a grocer and even
        result in some people having to go on welfare to pay for the increased prices of food. A magician must never
        take his or her actions lightly, especially when they influence or might influence the lives of others.</span>

    <h2 class="calibre29"><span class="calibre30">
        <span class="bold1">The Fire Wand</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Now we come to the construction of the last of the elemental tools of
        the magician. It is perhaps the best-known tool of the magician, too. It is the wand. Even stage magicians use
        wands in their acts, and perhaps no other magickal tool has caught the attention of the public more than the
        wand of the magician.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Curiously, many stage magicians dislike the idea of real magick. In
        England, for many years they did not even call it “magic,” but “conjuring.” There, a stage magician was called a
        “conjurer.” But even they present a front of real magick. There is a saying among such magicians that they are
        actors pretending to be real magicians doing real magick.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Just as real magicians use various words of power, calling on higher
        spiritual entities or working with the strength of vibration, so, too, do stage magicians use such words. Of
        course, they mistakenly imply that just saying the word will have some sort of effect, and I hope that by this
        time you realize that’s not true; however, that’s a different discussion.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">One of the most popular of “magical words” among stage magicians is
        “Hocus Pocus.” This is simply a slightly garbled version of the magickal part of the Catholic Mass where the
        priest holds the sacrament and says in Latin, “<span class="italic">Hoc est corpus</span>” (“This is the body”).
        By his initiation as a priest and the authority he holds, combined with his mastery of Latin and of the Mass,
        the sacred wafer, through a process known as transubstantiation, becomes the body of God. Certainly the
        transformation of a wafer into a body is real magick at its highest.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">The wand is as closely identified with one who practices magick as Dr. Watson is with
        Sherlock Holmes. Yet, few people have ever seen a real ceremonial magician’s Fire wand. This wand is the tool
        for controlling or directing two things:<div class="calibre24">
          <div class="calibre25">
            <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">1. The magickal element of Fire.</span></blockquote>
          </div>
          <div class="calibre25">
            <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">2. The energy of the magician.</span></blockquote>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Look at the image below. It is the shape of a true magician’s wand.
        Does its outline look familiar? It is quite simply an image of an erect phallus! The energy mentioned above is
        the psycho-sexual energy that you have been learning to manipulate with the exercises and rituals in the first
        half of this course. Anyone who denies the psycho-sexual aspect of magick is either not telling the truth, is
        uninformed, or is not really a magician.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Those who practice magick under the traditions of Paganism, many of
        whom call themselves Witches, use the dagger as their primary weapon. The name used by many Pagans for this
        dagger, athame, is likely taken from a Kabalistic book, <span class="italic">The Greater Key of Solomon</span>
        where it is called an “arthame.” Ceremonial magicians, on the other hand, use a wand as their primary tool. It
        is not, however, the Fire wand, but an even superior wand, which will be described later in this lesson.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In the meantime, you will need to construct the Fire wand. Make it out
        of a dowel. Make it any length and thickness you desire, but remember it must fit on your altar. Some
        lumberyards or hardware stores may have a decorative end piece for furniture (known generally as a “finial”)
        called an “acorn.” Attaching this to the end of the wand will yield a perfect shape. Otherwise you can carve a
        block of balsa wood and attach it to the end of the wand with glue and a dowel pin. If you have access to a
        lathe, the entire wand can be carved out of a thicker dowel. If you use two pieces of wood joined with glue, use
        two or three extra undercoats and then give it several coats of bright red paint. The multiple coats of paint
        will help to hold the pieces together. Let this paint dry very well.</span></div>

          <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Remember Wilhelm Reich? He was the follower of Freud who
              maintained that Freud had been correct when originally considering libido to be an actual energy. Reich

              very stuff from which life was made. It could affect anything.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">He found that he could make a device that looked like gun
              turrets on a battleship, only they were telescoping tubes up to eighteen feet long that ran via cables to
              a deep water source. He called this device a “cloudbuster.” He used it on the desert outside of Tucson,
              Arizona, in the 1950s. The place was so dry, there had been no growth of grass for over fifty years. He
              used it for several months. The result was not rain, but the water table rose to a level higher than
              anyone remembered. Grass grew on the desert for the first time in decades. Was he responsible?</span>

          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In 1953 there was a drought in Maine. Several blueberry farmers
              brought him in to make rain. The weather bureau forecast no rain. He went and used his cloudbuster. Ten
              hours after starting it, the rain began. Over the next few days it rained almost two inches. The blueberry
              crop was saved and the farmers paid him for his services. They credited him with the end of the
              drought.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Worried that causing rain to occur in one location might cause
              an absence elsewhere, resulting in a lawsuit, Reich ceased using the cloudbuster to bring rain, using it
              instead to shoot down enemy UFOs he believed were powered by orgone. But it was his work with the
              universal energy that got him in trouble with the government.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">He made some experimental boxes the size of telephone booths
              that would accumulate orgone. He believed that by being bathed in this energy he could help people heal.
              As with many physicians, he leased the devices to cancer patients who were in the last stages of the
              disease. He said they were for experimental use and admitted that all of the patients who used it had
              died. The Food and Drug Administration claimed he was falsely telling people he could cure their cancer.
              Working with the legal system, they had him thrown in jail. Then they went to his headquarters and
              destroyed all of his accumulators and, like a nightmare out of Nazi Germany, burned his books.</span>

        circumference of the wand at the base and at the bottom of the acorn section of the wand. Divide the length of
        the wand between the two stripes into three equal sections, and separate those sections with two more stripes.
        Thus, there should be a total of four yellow stripes and three sections of red paint, plus the top of the acorn

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Some people insist that there should be a magnetized wire running the
        length of the wand. This is exceedingly difficult to do as it requires the drilling of a very long hole or
        splitting the wand and gluing it back together. If you wish to include the wire you might try using a hollow
        piece of cane for the wand’s shaft and running the wire through its length. Or you could use a lightweight pipe.
        Then fill the remaining space with a combination of glue and sawdust. The north end of the magnetized wire (it
        repels the north pole of the compass) should be at the plain end of the wand. The wire should extend only
        one-sixteenth inch from the flat end and through the acorn finial or carved end.</span></div>

        </span></span></h1>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">So far we have spent much time dealing with the Sephiroht and very
        little time discussing the <span class="italic">paths</span> on the Tree of Life that link the Sephiroht. Many
        books on the Kabalah and the Tree of Life spend almost their entire length covering the Sephiroht and ignoring
        or at least slighting the paths. This is not surprising, because there is a very logical reason for the paths
        being so hard to pin down.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The Sephiroht, in a sense, are way stations for the energy of Divinity
        (Ruach El-oh-heem) as it descends toward the Microcosm, which is our Universe and our World. As this energy
        travels through the Tree of Life it changes and evolves (although its inner essence remains constant). By the
        time it reaches Mahl-koot it is at a level where humanity can deal with it on a day-to-day basis.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Just as the current “punctuated equilibrium” theory of evolution
        proposes jumps in evolution rather than changes at a steady rate, so, too, does the energy traversing the Tree
        of Life change neither slowly nor evenly. In its path from its ultimate pure form to the physical manifestations
        around us, it changes until it reaches the utmost point of a certain level or quality. Then it goes in a
        different direction.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In the diagram below you can see how a form of vibrational energy,
        color, changes from white to black. It can definitely be said that within the circle labeled “white” it looks
        white, and in the circle labeled “black” it appears black. But what about in between? Where is it pure grey?
        Where is it light grey? To complicate matters even more, two people seeing the same shade of grey might label it
        differently.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This is exactly the problem faced when trying to understand and
        describe the paths on the Tree. The Sephiroht in some Kabalistic literature are called the “vessels.” These
        vessels hold the energy of Divinity until it reaches a maximum in some direction. As an example, the Sephira
        Gih-boo-rah represents the ultimate manifestation of the strength of the Godhead as typified by the astrological
        qualities of the planet Mars. Page after page could be spent discussing the Strength of Divinity. But how does
        one describe the changing energy between Strength and Beauty, between Gih-boo-rah and Tih-fehr-et? It is far
        more difficult.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It is for this reason that a good Tarot reading can be given using
        only the Major Arcana of the Tarot. They are associated with the paths on the Tree and thus demonstrate the
        changing energies in a person’s life. The Minor Arcana are associated with the Sephiroht and are thus more
        related to static situations. The Minor Arcana adds more details. The Major Arcana gives more information as to
        the direction of a person’s life and the forces in play about that life.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre2"><img alt="114" src="images/000148.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The very fact that the paths represent changing energy patterns makes
        them difficult to describe. Later, through the process known as Kabalistic Pathworking you will learn for
        yourself the changing qualities of the paths and how they apply to you. For now, however, we will merely look at
        some of the important correspondences for the paths on the Tree of Life.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">On the next three pages you will find lists of Kabalistic
        Correspondences for the paths. There are twenty-two paths, numbered from 11 to 32. The first ten “paths” are
        actually the ten Sephiroht. This, then, points out a preliminary problem in dealing with the paths: their
        numerations. As I have said, the paths are traditionally numbered from 11 to 32. However, each path is also
        associated with a Hebrew letter. Since each Hebrew letter also has an associated number, there are, so far, two
        numbering schemas for the paths. Notice that the unusual numbering system for the Hebrew letters seems to be a
        mixture between Roman numerals and the Arabic numerals we commonly use.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Spelled out</span>: Three hundred
        forty-seven</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Roman numerals</span>: CCCXLVII (three hundreds
        [CCC], plus fifty [L], minus ten [X], plus five [V], plus two [II])</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Hebrew numerals</span>: Shin, Mehm, Zy-in (three
        hundred [Shin], plus forty [Mehm], plus seven [Zy-in])</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Arabic numerals</span>: 347</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Perhaps, then, Hebrew (or its source) is a basis for the numbers we
        use today.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The ancient Hebrews did not have separate symbols for their numbers in
        addition to each letter also representing a number. We will discuss more of this in a later lesson.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">But for now it is enough to see that the 11th path is also the first or Aleph path. The
        22nd path is also the 30th or Lah-med path. The 30th path is also the 200th or Resh path. Note also that the
        Major Arcana cards, being associated with the paths, also use their numbers to identify the paths. Thus, the
        19th path is also the 8th or Strength path. The 30th path is also the 19th or Sun path. We can come up with some
        rather unusual-looking “equations” which, if you know the secret, make perfect sense. Otherwise they are
        indecipherable:<div class="calibre2"><img alt="115" src="images/000184.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>
        <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I mention this multiple numeration system here not because it is vital
        to this course (although we will be making good use of it later), but because so many advanced books throw
        numbers around left and right, and a beginner could quite easily get lost. Remember, one of the goals of this
        course is to allow you to read any Kabalistic work and, if it is logical and based on tradition, understand
        it.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The first column of correspondences is the path number. This is
        followed by the number of the Hebrew letter, the Hebrew letter’s name, and the way it appears. This is followed
        by a translation of the meaning of each of the Hebrew letters. Where I have spelled out the name of the letter,
        I have done so in a way that you can see how it is pronounced. As an example of this, Zy-in, meaning “sword” is
        frequently spelled “Zain.” This leads to people pronouncing it “Zane,” which is incorrect. The next column has
        the number and names of the Major Arcana cards of the Tarot.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The final column on the first page of correspondences lists the King
        Scale (K.S.) colors for the paths on the Tree of Life. As you should remember, there are four scales of colors
        associated with the four Kabalistic Worlds. They are identified with names of the face cards of the Tarot as
        used by the Golden Dawn: Princess, Prince, Queen, and King. The Sephiroht are, for our purposes, colored
        according to the Queen Scale. The Paths follow the King Scale colorings. This keeps the inherent gender balance
        within the Tree. It also points to the moving energy (archetypal male) of the paths and the contained energy
        (archetypal female) of the Sephiroht. When a Tree is colored according to this combined system it is called the
        <span class="italic">Minitum Mundum</span>, or Little World. It will be an important focus of our later work, so
        you should consider making one in a very large size. When so done it is referred to as “the Temple Diagram.” You
        might also consider purchasing one in poster size from one of the many occult shops, both local and online, that
        carry them.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Although not vital to the purposes of our course, it would certainly
        benefit you to color in complete Trees of Life in each of the color scales. A complete list of these can be
        found in Regardie’s <span class="italic">The Golden Dawn</span>, Crowley’s <span class="italic">777</span>,
        David Godwin’s <span class="italic">Godwin’s Cabalistic Encyclopedia</span>, or Skinner’s <span
          class="italic">The Complete Magician’s Tables</span>.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The second page of correspondences for the paths begins again with a
        listing of the path numbers. This is followed by astrological listings of the planets and the constellation
        signs plus Air, Water, and Fire, the three primary elements according to the <span class="italic">Sepher
          Yetzirah</span>. The next column consists of various animals, both real and imaginary, associated with the
        paths. An Anchorite was an early Christian Hermit. The other animal names should be clear. Their importance to
        you will become obvious in a later lesson. So, too, will the next column of magickal plants. Note that
        associated with the 29th path are unicellular organisms, which are not animals, but plants.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The third page of path correspondences begins again with the path
        numbers. The next two columns, which associate stones and scents or perfumes with the paths, should be clear.
        The final column lists the magickal tools or weapons. Going from top to bottom we find that the girdle is listed
        as a magickal tool. This is not the modern device made to hold in an oversized stomach. Rather, it is an
        ornament that surrounds the waist and which is associated with Venus. It can be used for blindfolding and for
        fascination rituals. The horns are frequently worn in Pagan ceremonies to represent the power of the masculine
        aspect of the deity. Thus, it shows outgoing, archetypal masculine power. The burin is a tool like an ice pick
        and is used to carve talismans from wax as well as having other carving duties.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">For the 16th path in the Tools column, the term “preparations” means
        just that. The time you put into preparation for a magickal ritual and the time you put in studying to become a
        practitioner of the magickal arts is in itself a magickal technique. A tripod was traditionally used to support
        the incense burner. It was also used by the famous Oracle at Delphi. A tripod suspending a chair was placed over
        a crevice into the earth from which fumes were escaping. The <span class="italic">Pythia</span>, a priestess to
        Apollo, would sit in the chair and be asked questions to which she would respond in an oracular fashion. Her
        divination abilities may have been caused by the sulfurous fumes altering her body chemistry and affecting her
        mind. Another explanation would be that the fumes altered her consciousness, allowing Apollo to possess her and
        respond prophetically. A furnace is used here in alchemical sense. It means a place of work.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The disciplines are those that you must go through to be able to do
        magick. The Cross of Equilibrium or Solar Cross is a symbol of your balancing of nature. The obligation is the
        vow you take when you are initiated or in your personal dedication.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The idea of pain being a magickal tool may surprise you, but it is
        true. I am not talking here about flagellation or other forms of bodily abuse, although some people involve this
        type of pain in their magickal work. The pain here is more psychological in nature. There will come a time when
        you will have to decide if the magickal path is correct for you. If you choose the magickal life, you will find
        that huge vistas of non-physical experience will be opened to you along with the love of Divinity showering upon
        your head. But most people in this world, no matter their professed spiritual beliefs, are diehard materialists
        at heart. They cannot keep up with you because they will either fear to do so or refuse to do so. As a result,
        you may find yourself drifting away from some friends and loved ones. This can be very painful. But those who
        follow spiritual, magickal paths must go their own way. Choose this path and you may know pain and loss, but the
        rewards will far exceed the costs. Why else would so many people strive to become magicians?</span></div>

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The last of the five items you will need to make is the Tablet of
        Union. This comes from the magickal system known as Enochian (“Ee-noh-kee-yan”). This system was discovered by
        Dr. John Dee (astrologer to Queen Elizabeth I) and his assistant, the mysterious, roguish Edward Kelly. Kelly,
        who always wore a hat pulled over his head to hide the fact that his ears had been cut off in punishment for a
        crime, functioned as Dee’s seer in a series of magickal experiments in 1581. The result of those experiments is
        the much talked-about and little understood system known as Enochian.</span></div>

        be the most powerful magickal system around. Paul Foster Case modeled his own order, the Builders of the Adytum
        (BOTA), after the Golden Dawn, of which he had been a member. Most of the outer order is focused around the
        Tarot. The rituals performed for the Inner Order are very close to those of the Golden Dawn. The main difference
        is that Case seems to have feared Enochian and removed all traces of it from his rituals.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The Tablet of Union represents the fact that your altar functions as
        the place where the four magickal elements meet, come together, are united. To make it you simply get a heavy
        piece of paper or cardboard and make a rectangle four units tall by five units wide. I do not specify the size
        of the units because you need to make it to fit in the center of the altar. Outline the spacings so the card is
        filled by twenty boxes: five across and four up and down. This should be done with very dark, black ink. The
        paper should be white. Fill in the card as follows:</span></div>
    <div class="calibre2"><img alt="120" src="images/000169.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">The letters, like the lines, should be as dark as possible. EXARP is
        the Enochian or Angelic name for the Spirit of Air. HCOMA is the name for the Spirit of Water and NANTA is the
        name of the Spirit of Earth, which leaves BITOM as the name for the Spirit of Fire. If you can, have the Tablet
        of Union laminated with a plastic coating or put it in a small frame.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Set up your altar with the Tablet of Union in the center so when you
        are behind the altar (west of the altar facing east) you can read the tablet. On each side of the Tablet should
        be one of the elemental tools you have made. To the east place the Air dagger. To the south place the Fire wand.
        To the west place the Water cup, and to the north place the Earth pentacle. There should be water in the
        cup.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">You will also need another dagger with which to do the LBRP. Candles
        to light the area are also nice, along with some incense burning. These items can be placed on tables around
        your area or on the floor. Be sure they will harm nothing nor start a fire. Prepare yourself for this ritual as
        described for the LBRP, and begin the next ritual.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Okay. <span class="italic">Before</span> you tear these pages into
        little bits and decide to abandon magick forever because it is so complicated, stop for just a second and notice
        that this time I have not included a summary. This is because for this ritual you should make up your own
        summaries. Instead of using regular-sized paper, I used 4 x 5 index cards. I was able to fit the entire ritual
        on both sides of three cards.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The Watchtower Ritual looks much longer than it really is because of
        all the added instructions I have given you within the text of the ritual. In practice, it takes little more
        than ten minutes <span class="italic">if</span> the LBRP and BRH are memorized.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">When you are making up your summaries or cards, be sure to go over how
        the invoking pentagrams are made. This was described in the last lesson. The Watchtower Ritual is a potent
        preparation for any magickal ritual.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Some of you may be familiar with the version published by Israel
        Regardie in his book <span class="italic">Ceremonial Magick</span>. I must warn you, however, that that book is
        filled with many errors. This can be verified by checking what is printed in that book against both Regardie’s
        <span class="italic">The Golden Dawn</span> and Laycock’s <span class="italic">Complete Enochian
          Dictionary</span>.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">For more information on the Enochian system, I suggest looking at the
        book <span class="italic">Enochian Magic for Beginners</span> by Donald Tyson or <span class="italic">Practical
          Enochian Magick</span> by Jason Augustus Newcomb. As long as you stay with the Enochian material as presented
        in this course, you will be able to use it safely and effectively. The material, as presented here, has been
        tested and practiced for over 100 years. If you investigate this form of magick further, I urge extreme caution.
        Some people claim that the reason Aleister Crowley was unsuccessful in his lifetime was because of errors he may
        have made when doing the “Enochian Calls” form of this magickal system. In any event, the main thrust of this
        course is toward the Kabalah and not Enochiana.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">At this point in your studies it would be a good idea to practice this
        ritual at least once a week. Notice that I said <span class="italic">practice</span> this ritual, not <span
          class="italic">perform</span> it. Separate it into sections and go over each section several times until you
        are very familiar with it. It would be best if you could memorize this ritual, as it will be a major focus of
        all the practical or Grey Magick work that is to follow. If you can’t memorize it, at least become very familiar
        with it.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It is not necessary to perform it and work with it over and over as
        you (should) have been doing with the LBRP, the BRH, the Middle Pillar, the Circulation of the Body of Light,
        and the Tarot Contemplation Ritual. This is because two other things are needed.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">First, the instruments or tools need the appropriate preparation. In a
        sense, they need to be initiated or dedicated to magickal service. Second, a final, ultimate magickal tool is
        needed. This ultimate tool must have some sort of universality in its nature so that it can virtually be used
        for any purpose, as opposed to the elemental tools which represent certain singular qualities. It is with this
        ultimate tool that the four elemental weapons will be energized, charged, and consecrated to their sacred,
        magickal tasks. More on this tool in a moment.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Meanwhile, it would be a good idea to spend some time thinking about
        how the Watchtower Ritual could be done with a group. The exact division of parts must be determined by the
        number of people who will be working with you. If you have at least four people in your group, each person can
        represent one of the elements throughout the ceremony. If there are five people, four can represent the elements
        and the fifth can do the other sections of the ritual that are not totally related to one of the elements; that
        one person should sit in the east when not actively involved in the ceremony. This person can be the leader of
        the group (at least during the ceremony), and should not take part in the circumambulations. This person
        represents spiritual wisdom and Light. Light rises, like the Sun, from the east, so this person (representing
        Light) sits in the east while the others circumambulate. As they pass, they salute with the Sign of the Enterer
        in the direction they are going, not to the person. The respect is toward the philosophy and the sacred, secret
        science of Light, not to a person.</span></div>

        </span></span></h1>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">There is virtually no way to make a single tool that can work with the
        four elemental forces. Water would counteract the energies of elemental Fire, just as Air and Earth are also
        antithetical to each other. Therefore, to make a truly universal tool, another basis is needed.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">A possible thought would be to make a tool based on the Tarot cards.
        The problem with this is that it would require a minimum of twenty-two and possibly twenty-six (twenty-two Major
        Arcana plus one for each suit) or more sections. Such a tool would be either too large to be practical or have
        symbols or sections too small to be useful.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The solution to this problem is to use astrological symbolism. This
        brings our symbols down to twelve, one for each of the signs of the zodiac. To this we add two more for
        practical purposes, as you will see. The Golden Dawn associated this with Egyptian symbolism for the design of a
        fairly difficult-to-construct Lotus Wand. By removing only the Egyptian aspect, the lotus flower, we are left
        with our main tool for the performance of practical or Grey Magick: the Rainbow Wand.</span></div>

        <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">1. Start with a piece of dowel three-eighths to
            three-quarters inch in diameter. Judge the best diameter by holding various dowels and sensing which size
            “feels” best in your right hand (even if you are left-handed). Cut your chosen dowel to 36 ¼ inches in
            length. With sandpaper, round the ends so that the final length is exactly 36 inches. Now lightly sand the
            rest of your future wand to take off any surface dirt or uneven surfaces. Give the entire wand a white
            undercoat. Following the directions on your paints, wait the appropriate length of time, then give it a
            second white undercoat.</span></blockquote>

      <div class="calibre25">
        <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">2. Measure seven inches from one of the ends. At this point
            make a dark but narrow black line around the wand. Two inches farther from this line (nine inches from the
            end), make another black line. Continue making thin black lines until you have drawn a total of thirteen
            lines. The image of your wand at this point is that you have at one end a space of seven inches, at the
            other end a space of slightly under five inches, and between these two areas twelve spaces of two inches
            each. A simple way to get straight lines around your wand is by taking a small card, wrapping it around the
            circumference of the wand at the appropriate area, and using the edge of the card for a guide.</span>

    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The symbolism of the Rainbow Wand is both obvious and deep. First, we
        can see that white, the color used to represent the element of Spirit, also undercoats the entire wand. It is
        the basis for everything, even the darkness at the other end of the wand. If there was no light, how could you
        tell when it was dark?</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Second, notice that the color spectrum, the rainbow, only occupies the
        center part of the wand. In a similar manner, the wand, as a representation of our magickal power, takes us
        beyond the physical realms represented by the visible spectrum.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Third, the number of black lines is thirteen, the number of unity

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Once you have spent at least one month working with your Rainbow Wand
        as described above, you will be ready to fully consecrate and charge it to magickal purposes. Be sure you work

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Finally we move to the last of our consecration rites. While it is
        true that continual usage of the magickal tools will have the effect of charging and consecrating them, it is
        also true that doing these rituals, even if you only do them once in your life, will speed up the process many
        times over. However, it is also suggested that you repeat these rituals occasionally, perhaps once or twice a
        year. As you develop as a magician, so, too, will your ability to charge, empower, and consecrate your
        tools.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Another purpose of these consecration rituals is to allow you to see
        how one basic ritual, through additions and relatively small variations, becomes applicable to other purposes.
        In this case, a ritual used to consecrate one magickal weapon, by changing a few words and actions, becomes
        usable for consecrating other tools. In time you will see the importance of this idea.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It is also important to discuss these consecration rituals as they
        would be performed in a ceremonial situation. That is, how they should be done in group workings. To answer this
        we again look back to the Golden Dawn. To that organization, the consecrations were a symbol of a person’s
        passing from the Outer, <span class="italic">Mystical</span> Order (The Golden Dawn) and into the Inner, <span
          class="italic">Magickal</span> Order (the R.R. &amp; A.C.). Thus, the person doing the consecrations should
        either do them privately or only with those who have already done their own consecrations. No one else should
        watch. Those who do watch should add their visualizations to those of the person doing the consecration. It is
        important that the person doing the consecration do the entire ritual by himself or herself.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">When you have finished performing these rites to your satisfaction (we
        are harder judges of ourselves than we are of others), you will no longer be a beginner or neophyte in the world
        of magick. Very few have started down the path leading to a magickal way of life. Even fewer go past the first
        few faltering steps. It is a miniscule number, indeed, who can claim to be true masters of the magickal
        art.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">No, you are by no means a master of ceremonial magick even if you have
        really practiced and learned from these first six lessons. But from my experience, if you have practiced and
        learned, you probably are more knowledgeable and magickally adept than 75 to 95 percent of those calling
        themselves magicians. This is true even though you have not as yet done any real practical or Grey
        Magick.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It is not well known, but there were really two “inner” orders in the
        Golden Dawn. No members of the Outer Order were supposed to know about either of these inner orders or their
        workings. One of these inner orders only had one degree and taught no magick. It was where people who were
        judged to have no magickal skills were placed. Even they were not aware of the full meaning of the magickal
        inner order, the R.R. <span class="italic">et</span> A.C. The name is a Latin abbreviation for “Red Rose and
        Gold Cross.” To get into the R.R. &amp; A.C., you needed to be invited. Once invited it was your task to make
        and consecrate your magickal tools.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Entry into a grade of a magickal order was done by initiation, meaning
        to start. A person did not have the full abilities of a degree when he or she entered that degree, only
        (theoretically) when it was left or completed.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Therefore, for all practical purposes, if you have done the work, done
        the study and understand what you are doing, for all reasonable purposes you have attained (entered) the grade
        of Adeptus Minor.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Furthermore, so long as you do not claim that grade as a result of

                    them. I will not make any symbol or talisman for those who are not truly in need of such help.
                    Before those with little knowledge of magick I will only perform simple and well-known techniques,
                    keeping the deeper wisdom and methods for those who are themselves ready to learn.</span></span>

                    and self-seeking. If in spite of this pledge I do so, then I invoke the avenging angel HUA that the

                    could give to any man or woman, until I am sure that his or her claim to knowledge is

        practicing and studying magick is dealing with other people concerning your interests. Generally speaking, there
        are four types of people you will be dealing with in relation to your magickal beliefs.</span></div>

            figure that this is something you are involved in and, so what? They think you’re a little bit weird, but
            they also probably think that everybody has a bit of weirdness in them.<div class="calibre17"><span
                class="calibre7">People in this category are usually too concerned with themselves to bother you. If
                they ask you any questions about what you do, answer them honestly but at their level of understanding.
                Usually after a few questions they lose interest in that aspect of your life because they find their own
                life far more interesting.</span></div>

      <div class="calibre25">
        <blockquote class="calibre21">
          <div class="calibre19">2. <span class="italic">Religious fanatics.</span> These people live a life based on
            fear and/or paranoia. Those who live a life filled with fear are the ones who are constantly trying to
            convert you from your beliefs and organizations, which they call “cults,” to their particular religious sect
            or cult, which, of course, they think is the sole arbiter of truth. They see everything as black and white,
            we and they. “Since we are right, you must be wrong. Therefore, I have to convert you to my faith because
            that way you will be right and there will be no one around to imply that I (horrors!) could be wrong. For if
            I am wrong about this, then I could be wrong about everything in my life, and I am too fearful to spend time
            examining my life.” This type of person is frequently (but not always) poorly educated when it comes to
            religion and philosophy. “It was good enough for Daddy, it’s good enough for me” is their operative motto.
            If it doesn’t fit on a bumper sticker, it’s too complex for them. If these people question you as to what
            you are doing, a good answer might be “studying early Jewish philosophy.” Then, immediately tell them that
            they can help you. Ask them if they study the Bible. When they say yes, respond, “Good. I need to talk with
            someone who is fluent in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek.” When they hem and haw and finally admit that they
            really know little if any of those languages, just look at them with surprise on your face and tell them
            that you hope they will someday really begin to study the Bible. Then walk away. Remember, we are not trying
            to convert anybody to our magickal point of view. If they are ready for it they will find it. If not, it
            won’t make any sense to them. In this section we are only learning appropriate ways to deal with others who
            do not share our beliefs.<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The other type of religious fanatic
                is the one filled with paranoia. These people are usually (but not always) poor and in a lower economic
                class (although being poor does not automatically make you one of them). They accept the responsibility
                for nothing in their lives. Their problems are always somebody else’s fault. They don’t have money
                because “Jews gypped them out of it.” (“Gypped” comes from the word “Gypsy.” Here is another minority
                group unfairly depicted in modern English.) Or else “Blacks (or more recently, Mexicans) took all the
                jobs.” It’s always somebody else’s fault.</span></div>
            <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As briefly mentioned earlier, those with this mind-set and a
                more religious (?) bent blame everything on “demons.” Demons cause their addiction to alcohol or tobacco
                or overeating. Demons keep them impotent or frigid. Demons control the bosses so “I can’t keep a job.”
                If this type of person asks you what you are doing, the best answer is, “minding my own business and
                wondering why you aren’t doing the same.”</span></div>
            <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Quite simply, these people have a very narrow focus to life
                and only want to deal with people who share their focus. Therefore, since your focus is wider than their
                narrow view, it is best to get away from them quickly. These people have the possibility of becoming
                quite dangerous. People with paranoid personalities may become schizophrenic and commit violently
                antisocial behavior. These are the people who roast their children in order to burn the demons out of
                them. These people were the sadists of the various inquisitions. When possible, stay away from
                them.</span></div>

            people, if they discover your interest in magick, will primarily try to mock and make fun of you. They don’t
            have to deal with you if you, and what you believe in, are merely jokes. Frequently, these people think they
            are very scientific. They may call themselves “skeptics.” In reality, they have a religion of their own
            making, usually an untrained belief in partially understood or obsolete scientific theories.<div

                all, it would be redundant! Although I don’t really suggest it, if the person is obnoxious, you could
                add to this by referring to his or her eating material, flies, and upon what material flies like to sit.
                Other allusions could be made to the similarity of the person’s appearance with that of a frog, etc. If
                you go this route, the idea is to turn the topic away from you and on to the other person.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">SSOTBME</span> is a small book that was
        originally published as I first began teaching occult topics. It’s a unique book in two ways. First, it was one
        of the first modern publications of some of the amazing, surrealistic art by occultist Austin Osman Spare.
        Second, many of the concepts hinted at in this book became incorporated into what would eventually be called
        Chaos Magick. I’ll talk more about that system in Lesson Twelve. The title of the book is not the name of some
        Enochian spirit. Rather, it is an abbreviation (Notarikon) for “Sex Secrets of the Black Magicians Exposed.”
        This shows a bit of the author’s attitude. There are no sex secrets in the book, it has nothing to do with black
        magicians, and it exposes nothing.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I agree with the author of <span class="italic">SSOTBME</span>, Ramsey
        Dukes (writing as Lemuel Johnston), who claims that there are four major viewpoints that we all have to a
        greater or lesser degree. These are logic, observation, feeling, and intuition. Mix intuition with logic and you
        get a religious bias. Mix feelings with intuition and you get an artistic bias. Mix logic with observation and
        you get a scientific bias. I choose to mix feelings with observation. The result is a magickal bias.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">From this philosophy, everything is relative. If you have a strong
        religious bias, science and art would appear in some instances to be forms of magick. A stronger scientific bent
        would have a person see economics and psychology as being more magickal or artistic than scientific. An artistic
        bias would have a person thinking that astrology and philosophy are very scientific. Who would be right? All of
        them&mdash;from their own particular points of view. Thus, if we can discover where a person’s particular bias
        lies, we can perhaps present our interests in ways that will be most easily understood by the person confronting
        us.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Remember, the important part of dealing with people who are
        confronting you is to quickly gain control of the conversation, then turn it around and talk about the other
        person rather than letting all the discussion be about you.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Back in Lesson Five of this course I shared with you the important
        occult magickal secret that whatever is created on the astral plane eventually must manifest in our world, the
        physical plane. This means, of course, that if you can create something in the astral world, it will eventually
        show up in our day-to-day reality. If you create wealth for yourself on the astral plane, you will become
        wealthy. If you create a new car for yourself on the astral, you will eventually get that car. Over the past few
        years there has been a flurry of interest in this technique. Unfortunately, most of the books and movies
        discussing this well-known “law of attraction” generally leave out the practical techniques necessary to use
        this “secret.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">From the simple, one-sentence description that whatever is created on
        the astral plane eventually must manifest in our world, it should be obvious that the basis for Grey Magick is
        the creation of a desired goal on the astral plane. The reason there are many different forms or styles of Grey
        Magick is that there are many ways to implant a creation into the astral or Yetziratic level of reality.
        Personally, I have always found ritual or ceremonial magick to be the most effective for me. This is because I
        find the use of intense symbolism mixed with ritual to be highly evocative. When well performed, a ceremony
        affects me very deeply. Plus, ritual magick also uses the assistance of spiritual entities from other planes of
        existence. I can use other forms of Grey Magick successfully, but I find them more tedious and a lot less
        fun.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">However, there is another system that is not ceremonial magick per se,
        but is important to know. A knowledge of this style of magick can aid you in your understanding of how magick
        works. Also, this system is very simple and effective. With this system you can successfully work magick with no
        tools other than a pencil and piece of paper.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As I have said, the major differences between various styles of magick
        are based upon different ways of getting an idea or thing created in the astral plane, or what is Kabalistically
        known as the Yetziratic world. So, in this simple system, we must first discover how this can be done.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Earlier in this course I described how there are links between the
        conscious and the unconscious minds. When our unconscious sends a message to the conscious, it is called
        “intuition.” If the conscious cannot deal with the information given by the unconscious and represses that
        information, psychological and even physical problems can occur. In some instances this can result in a person
        requiring psychological, psychiatric, or some form of therapeutic aid. There are also other methods for the
        unconscious to contact the conscious. If you have forgotten some of these, reread the previous sections on
        dreams and past-life experiences.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">More important for our purposes, however, is the fact that there are
        also methods that will allow the conscious to contact and send messages to the unconscious. This is important
        because <span class="italic"><span class="bold">the unconscious is our direct link to the astral
            plane</span></span>. This means that whatever we put into the unconscious must eventually become a physical
        reality.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There are two common ways for this conscious-to-unconscious
        communication to occur at will. They relate to the modern right-brain, left-brain theories of mentality. The
        left hemisphere of the brain is said to deal with logic, mathematics, and deductive reasoning. The right
        hemisphere deals with intuition, inductive reasoning, feeling, and art.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Before going on I am going to interject that I do not believe in the
        total reality of this theory. Its implication is that the mind, that part of our total self that actually
        thinks, is nothing more than the few pounds of nervous tissue between our ears. My personal belief is that there
        is a type of symbiotic relationship that exists between the physical brain and the non-physical mind. An example
        of this is the fact that the taking of certain drugs and substances can alter the way we think and perceive the
        universe around us. This has led some people to claim that consciousness and even emotions such as love are
        nothing more than a chemical state. It implies that introducing those drugs would create an emotion. However,
        techniques such as hypnosis and biofeedback have shown that it is easily possible to create those chemicals
        without the associated emotion, and vice versa. Further, some people may remain entirely unaffected by
        substances that would have an enormous psychoactive effect on most of us. Altering the chemical makeup of the
        brain does not <span class="italic">necessarily</span> change the workings of the mind. This invalidates the
        idea that the mind and brain, even though closely linked in most people, are one and the same.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Furthermore, the right-brain, left-brain theory is an
        oversimplification of the complex reality of the mind-brain unit. Still, as a theory, it does have some value.
        It functions as a metaphor for understanding the functioning of the mind. Primarily it shows that the mind has a
        type of duality. Perhaps it would be more appropriate to say that a part of the mind deals more with the
        intuitive while another part deals more with the deductive. Further, these parts of the mind are related to what
        is commonly called the right-brain, left-brain theory. In order to facilitate your understanding of this
        course’s material I will use the right-brain, left-brain terminology as a concession to popular terms.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The system of magick associated with the left brain is commonly known
        as the “Use of Positive Affirmations.” In this system you merely say over and over what it is you desire. This,
        in a sense, is an attempt to use your conscious to convince your unconscious through reason, logic, and
        repetition that “this-or-that” is what you want, desire, or need.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The system that is related to the right hemisphere of the brain is
        known as “Creative Visualization.” In this system you consciously put an image (through the process known as
        visualization) into your conscious mind, knowing that eventually this image will be absorbed into the
        unconscious.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It should be obvious that people who use either Positive Affirmations
        or Creative Visualizations are only using half of their mind/brains in order to create a different reality in
        their lives. Some people are very successful using either system. Most people practicing one system or the other
        have only a modicum of success. The simple Kabalistic system that I am going to present uses a very effective
        combination of both Positive Affirmations <span class="italic">and</span> Creative Visualization. Both I and
        many of my students have found the Kabalistic system to be far more magickally effective than either Creative
        Visualization or Positive Affirmation by themselves. Also, there is a Kabalistic secret which will help improve
        magickal success with these combined systems. But I will get to that in a few moments.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">First, let us assume that someone knows how to create something on the
        astral plane. Does this mean that this person will always get what is created? Clearly, many people attempt
        Creative Visualization and/or Positive Affirmations and have no successful result. Just ask the vast majority of
        people who have experienced the futility of trying to use the incomplete principles given in some of the popular
        books. Perhaps you have tried one of these systems and not achieved the result you desired. Thus, to a casual
        observer or one who is unfamiliar with the inner secrets of these forms of mental magick, it will seem that the
        answer to my rhetorical question is “No, a person does not always get what he or she creates on the astral
        plane.” But, once you understand the following information, you will see that the real answer is “Yes, a person
        <span class="italic">always</span> gets what he or she creates on the astral plane.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">You may see that as a contradictory statement. First I point out that
        people who try to use the law of attraction via Creative Visualization and/or Positive Affirmations rarely get
        what they have created on the astral plane through the use of those techniques. Then I say that they always get
        what they create. Either I’m being contradictory or something isn’t clear. And what isn’t clear is that there
        are secrets that have been left out of some of the books on the law of attraction. Perhaps an example will make
        this more apparent.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Let us assume that “John Magus” is a man who knows how to create
        things on the astral plane using Creative Visualization and Positive Affirmations. He spent fifteen minutes this
        morning creating wealth for himself on the astral plane. He used all of the right words, expressed in the
        appropriate way. He used all of the appropriate visualizations. Then he spent five minutes worrying about how he
        was going to pay his bills. Later he spent ten minutes thinking about how little money he had. All day he
        thought about his crummy, poorly-paying job. When he arrived home from work he saw more bills in the mail and
        worried about them and about how he was going to raise the money to pay for them. So although Mr. Magus had
        spent fifteen minutes creating wealth, he spent hours throughout the day thinking about, and thus creating,
        poverty on the astral plane. To repeat, he is creating his own poverty. That is why he is, and remains,
        poor.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">You see, <span class="italic"><span class="bold">we are constantly
            creating on the astral plane!</span></span> Most of the systems of Creative Visualization or Positive
        Affirmations which you may read about or study do not take this occult fact into consideration. The Kabalistic
        system I am about to share with you will show you exactly how to be in control of this process.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If you saw what John Magus was doing and didn’t know that we are
        always creating on the astral plane, you might think that John Magus was failing in his attempt to create
        wealth. But although it is true that he failed to create wealth, he was successful&mdash;in creating the poverty
        he was spending so much time thinking about. Remember, we are always creating on the astral plane <span
          class="italic"><span class="bold">whether or not we are consciously trying to do so.</span></span></span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There are a few other reasons why Positive Affirmations and Creative
        Visualization may not appear to be successful. First, there is an important cosmic law that forbids waste. One
        author refers to the effect of this law as “the Sphere of Availability.” If you cannot afford food on which to
        live, yet you use either or both of the systems so far described in an attempt to obtain a car, you may not
        achieve your goal. This is because you would really not be able to use the car effectively. If you can’t afford
        food, how will you be able to afford fuel, oil, insurance, tires, brakes, etc.? It would be a waste for you to
        own a car, and cosmic law forbids waste.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">A version of this law is used in physics. Since cosmic law forbids
        waste, this includes wasted space. Thus it is said that “nature abhors a vacuum.” It is important to understand
        that merely because something may look wasteful to you does not mean that on a cosmic scale it would be
        wasteful. Don’t worry about what somebody else is trying to create. Make sure that what you are trying to bring
        into your life is necessary for you. John Magus should work to get a job before he works to get a car.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Another reason for apparent lack of success may be due to karmic
        lessons that you need to learn for your mental and spiritual evolution. If you need to learn a lesson related to
        poverty, there will be no way for you to break out of that poverty . . . until you have learned the lesson(s)
        necessary for your evolutionary advancement and poverty is no longer necessary.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP ONE</span>. Start by writing down on a piece
        of paper the following statement:</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">“It is my will to use all of my abilities to
          obtain the following goal: _______________.”</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">At the end of the statement fill in whatever it is you want.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre24">

        <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">b. Be specific! Most people do not want “money.” They want
            money for a purpose such as a better lifestyle, a better car, etc. So put that ultimate purpose in the blank
            at the end of the statement. If that purpose is a long-term goal, choose the first step toward that goal. If
            it is your aim to be a teacher, it should be your first goal to get the training necessary for you to teach.
            If it is your goal to do something noble, such as “to serve,” that is very good. But serve in what way? A
            doctor serves, but so does a garbage collector, a plumber, a hypnotherapist, or a waitress. Each needs a
            vastly different skill set and each needs different types of training to become successful in their

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP TWO</span>. Now make a visual picture of
        yourself <span class="italic">involved</span> in that goal. If you want a car, see yourself in that car. If you
        want a better lifestyle, see yourself wearing something that represents that lifestyle, etc. This image will be

            rather than cut them out. Be sure to include yourself in the Treasure Map either by putting a picture of

          <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">The concept of SMART goals and DUMB goals moved from the
              mystical to the world of management in 1950s. The concepts were well known to mystics and magicians, but
              were codified and clarified by Peter Drucker in his book <span class="italic">The Practice of
                Management</span>. We can reverse that process and determine the validity and quality of a goal we want
              to manifest using Grey Magick.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">All of your magickal goals should be SMART. In this instance,

              par) on every hole in one round of golf has never previously been attained on a professional course, so
              there is no reason to assume you can attain it. As a general rule, if someone else has achieved something,
              there is no reason why you cannot also achieve it.</span></div>

              tour is unrealistic. Nobody of that age has ever done it. However, it would be realistic to try to get on
              the seniors golf tour.</span></div>

              If you want to lose twenty pounds but don’t put a time frame on that loss, you will always want to lose it
              but may never actually attain that loss. Similarly, if the time frame for that loss, say two weeks, is
              unrealistic or unhealthy, it is also a poor choice for a goal.</span></div>

              people around you, and good for the planet.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Some people suggest that your goals should be DUMB: <span

              concepts embodied in the acronym, I don’t think that focusing on being dumb is positive, and the ideas in
              the DUMB acronym are implied in the SMART(E) goals system.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Aleister Crowley wrote about a time he was low on money. He did a

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">“Sort-of ” wanting something will not have the success of “gotta-have”
        something. The more emotionally worked up you get over your desire&mdash;especially when stating that desire and
        doing the visualization&mdash;the faster it will manifest. As it says in <span class="italic">The Book of the
          Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage</span>, “Inflame thyself with prayer.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">That, very simply, is the Kabalistic system of mental magick. Practice
        the system daily until you get what you want. Then <span class="italic">immediately</span> start anew with
        another goal. Keep your emotions high and success must inevitably follow. Record results in your ritual or
        magickal diary.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Some people wonder why the peculiar wording is used for the magickal
        phrase given in Step One. The choice of words is very important and should always be used. “It is my will . . .”
        means that you are using your consciousness, and putting that aspect of yourself in charge of the unconscious.
        Most people tend to allow their unconscious to control them without even knowing it. These four words indicate a
        change in your life: you are no longer an ordinary person. You are becoming a true magician.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">“ . . . to use all of my abilities . . .” is important because it is
        telling your unconscious that all abilities which you possess, whether you are aware of them or not, are to be
        used in achieving the goal. Thus, even if you are not aware of your innate psychic powers, your unconscious, as
        a result of being ordered to do so by your conscious, will cause those powers to be put to use to achieve your
        goal.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">“ . . . to obtain the following goal . . .” Here the important word is
        “goal.” This is not a light-hearted wish or mild desire. This is a goal toward which you will be directing your
        entire life at this time. If you cannot direct all of your efforts toward that goal, don’t even start this
        process. Let’s say that you want an expensive book on magick and you use the Kabalistic system of mental magick
        to obtain it. But then, instead of saving your money, you spend it on some CDs or MP3s or going to a club or a
        movie. This is a message to your unconscious that you do not really want to achieve the goal of getting the
        book. Your unconscious will comply with this and help you achieve the goal of not getting the book.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Although in this particular instance I am saying that it is important
        to save your money for the book, I am not saying that it will be necessary to spend all of your money for the
        book. Nowhere in the magickal phrase of intent does it say <span class="italic">how</span> you are to obtain the
        goal. Let it come to you as it will. Don’t try to dictate how something should come to you. You must still use
        all of your abilities to obtain it. In this case, it means saving your money. In the instance of Crowley
        mentioned earlier, he had done a ritual to obtain all of the money he would need so that he could pay a rent
        bill. What little he had at that time was not relevant, since he was not going to go out and get work to earn
        money.</span></div>

        <span class="bold1">Magick High and Low</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Throughout this course I have described three types of magick: White
        Magick, which has been the focal point so far in this course; Grey Magick, which we have begun to investigate
        and which will occupy most of the rest of this course; and Black Magick, which will only be discussed in terms
        of how to avoid doing it either purposely or accidentally. These definitions of types of magick have used the
        purpose and outcome of a magickal ritual or act to determine the type of magick we are doing. As an example, any
        techniques or rituals used to help us achieve a closer relationship with Divinity are defined as White
        Magick&mdash;any techniques. What you <span class="italic">do</span> doesn’t determine the type of magick you
        have performed. Rather, what you <span class="italic">get</span> is the basis of the definition. A person could
        use the same techniques, but depending upon the goal and/or results, the type of magick would be different. The
        important thing to understand about this, then, is that when using the terms White, Grey, or Black Magick,
        purpose (or result) determines definition.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">You may have heard of other ways of differentiating types of magick.
        Some people use multiple colors. Others give different definitions for the meanings of White, Grey, or Black
        Magick. I’m not trying to dictate and say that the definitions given in this course are the only allowable
        definitions; I’m just saying these are the definitions used in this course. As long as someone defines what he
        or she means by a term, that’s fine with me.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There is another definition of different types of magick I’d like to
        discuss. These definitions are based upon heredity, the ancient source of the style of magick. There are two
        major categories based on history. The type of magick we have studied, and for the most part will be studying,
        is based in the structure of city life. It was in cities where the middle classes first evolved. It was in
        cities where leisure became possible on a weekly if not daily basis. A merchant who lived in a city could work
        from “nine to five,” whereas those people who lived and worked on farms had to work virtually from before
        sunrise to after sunset. In the city, people were able to have extra time to learn how to read and study. Thus,
        the style of magick that has evolved out of city lifestyles tends to include long, precise spells, complicated
        formulae, and sometimes involved astrological preparations. It is a style of magick that is left-brain, logic
        oriented.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The city-dwelling middle classes and upper classes had time for
        leisure and study. They also had enough excess capital&mdash;extra and spendable money&mdash;to afford ritual
        items. Some of these ritual tools were made of gold or silver, showing that if some of the magicians were not
        upper class, then they received support or patronage from a wealthy person or group.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Practically from the beginning of time, many cities were built on high
        ground near a source of fresh water. Being on high ground was necessary because it was an easy place to defend
        against attackers. Also such a city would have a natural drainage system thanks to gravity. Such drainage
        systems, especially after rains, would help prevent flooding and the health problems associated with standing,
        stagnant water. The style of magick that we have been learning in this course, the style of magick which
        developed in cities located near high ground, is known as High Magick or Art Magick.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Every culture had, has, and will have its own magick. At the time High
        Magick or Art Magick was developing in the cities, so, too, were the magickal systems of those people who lived
        outside of the cities. It was the magick of the farmers and hunters and animal herders that evolved from even
        earlier magicks of the earliest, prehistoric tribes of hunters and gatherers by way of various religio-magickal
        systems.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Farming life has always been very difficult. In the Middle Ages there
        were only basic tools and no real insecticides, fertilizers, or irrigation systems that worked at the turn of a
        faucet. True, the Nile culture and the Aztec culture did have irrigation systems. And it is also true that
        people knew that various herbs would keep away certain insects and manure could be used to fertilize the soil.
        Still, the people of 100-10,000+ years ago had nothing to compare to our modern “green revolution.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">These hard-working farmers could not take the time to learn how to
        read or study arcane magickal texts and lore. Instead, they learned the laws of the universe from the gracious
        Mother Nature. They saw how the Moon affected their lives and crops. They saw the importance of air, earth,
        heat, and water. Having little knowledge of writing, their magick was passed orally. They developed their own
        language and codes. They studied and learned the powers of the plants around them. And some, following the Roman
        and Greek pantheon, worshipped a beautiful goddess, represented by the Moon, and a strong god of the hunt,
        represented by the Sun. Although there is no evidence that there was ever a “universal” goddess religion, there
        is ample evidence of a goddess tradition in virtually every ancient culture. According to one respected author,
        Raphael Patai, the ancient Hebrews worshipped a goddess along with their god and even had an altar to her in the
        first and second temples, up to the year 70 C.E. Today, many Christians hold Mary in very high esteem, to the
        point where some are accused of “Mariolatry.” Jews still honor the “Sabbath Bride” and welcome the coming of the
        Moon. In Hebrew, the word for Moon is “Levannah,” which also happens to be the name of an ancient Semitic Moon
        goddess.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Perhaps you remember from your study of history the so-called “divine
        right of kings.” This included such things as the pick of the crops and animals raised by those who lived in
        their kingdoms, the right to ride through the crops of a farmer who lived in a king’s domain, even the right to
        have sex with a woman before her husband on their wedding night! In return, the king was expected to protect the
        farmer from foreign invaders. In times of such danger, farmers and their families could run to the king’s castle
        for protection. Thus, they did not need to live and work on high ground. Further, the terracing of hilly areas
        was a terrible chore. It was far easier to live in lower-lying lands where there was both natural irrigation
        from rains and the washing of fertile soil from the higher areas by that same rain. The magick that developed
        from these cultures is known as Natural Magick or Low Magick.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It is important to point out that there is no quality judgment or
        moral judgment based upon the terms High Magick and Low Magick. They are simply different methods of achieving
        the same goals with the primary differences between them being cultural and technical. As the centuries passed
        and the cultures of both city dweller and rural inhabitants developed, problems arose for practitioners of High
        and Low Magick. Organized religion, especially Christianity in the form of the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy
        and later even more so by the various Protestant authorities, did not want people who either could work or were
        believed to work “miracles.” Only those who were involved with the various churches were supposed to be able to
        do this. The High Magick practitioners were able to present a façade of Christian worship in their practices and
        in many instances they were, for a while, able to avoid persecution.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Not so for the people who did Low Magick. Not only could they do
        things that the organized religion did not like (magick), but they also worshipped deities who were not the same
        as the ones worshipped by those in power. The organized religions tried to wipe these people out, insultingly
        referring to them as “people of the heath” or heathens. Similarly, in Latin the expression meaning “those of the
        earth,” <span class="italic">paganus</span>, became the then-insulting term “pagan.” Originally the words
        “pagan” and “heathen” were just descriptions, but they became virtually a rallying cry for genocide.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Initially, the worst problem was not that these people practiced Low
        Magick, but that they worshipped different gods and goddesses. In the sixth century the Pope wrote, if “heathen
        temples are well built they should be purified from the worship of demons . . . In this way the people, seeing
        their temples are not destroyed, may flock more readily to their accustomed” places of worship. Of course, to
        the Pope any god that was not his God must be a demon.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">But conversion was not enough. The organized Christian religion took
        an image of the Roman god Pan, horned, hoofed, and tailed, and said that this image was the image of their chief
        source of evil, Satan (try to find that description of Satan anywhere in the Jewish Bible). Thus, “heathens” and
        “pagans” who still worshipped their God and Goddess were told they were worshipping evil demons. These people,
        wanting to worship their own deities, became “Satan” worshippers to organized religion. As such, they lost their
        human status, and were persecuted, tortured in unbelievably foul ways, and killed in surprisingly large numbers.
        Some say the number of Pagans tortured and killed by Christians, over the course of hundreds of years, was under
        100,000. Other authorities claim the numbers rival or surpass the Jewish Holocaust perpetrated by the Nazis. But
        the Pagans were not destroyed by the Nazis. They were victims of Catholics and Protestants.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Those Pagans who escaped hid from their persecutors. Their religious
        aspects went “underground,” and those people became known as healers and masters of the herbs. Much of the
        various traditions was lost. Some of the women who kept up their skills as healers and herbalists also
        remembered some of the religious aspects that they taught to their daughters and sometimes to others. They
        became known, quite appropriately, as “wise women.” It was said that these people could bend reality to their
        wills. A word used to describe these people and which means “to bend” is “Wicca” (masculine) or “Wicce”
        (feminine; pronounced “wee-cha”). In English, this word became “Witch.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This has been a very brief generalized history of Witches. I make no
        claim to its perfection in any way, and there are many books that can give you a far more detailed history of
        this subject than I can do in a few paragraphs. What I do want to make clear is that Witches do not worship the
        devil, do not perform the infamous Black Mass, and do not kiss the Devil’s hindquarters. These were all fictions
        created by organized Christianity to cast a bad light on those who worshipped in a different light.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Every schoolchild in the U.S. knows that “in fourteen hundred and
        ninety-two, Columbus sailed the ocean blue.” What the children are not told is that in the same year Isabella
        and Ferdinand ordered all Jews to leave Spain, convert to Christianity, or be killed. Remember, the Jews held
        the secrets of the Kabalah, which is one of the sources for High Magick.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Some Jews converted and some left. Others, known as the <span
          class="italic">conversos</span>, pretended to convert. Others hid in the countryside, aided by the people of
        the countryside, many of whom were Witches. The same sort of thing appears to have happened all over Europe,
        with Witches protecting Kabalistic Jews, and, in some cases, Jews protecting Witches. At this time there came to
        be a slight mixture between the High Magick of the Kabalists and the Low Magick of the Witches as each shared
        gratefully with the other.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Some people have asked me how this could be possible, considering that
        Jews are given the injunction “Thou shalt not suffer a Witch to live.” Well, first off, that is an incorrect
        translation from the Hebrew. But don’t take my word for this. Find a translation of the Jewish Bible in a Jewish
        bookstore and look it up for yourself (Exodus 22, v.18). The correct translation, you will find, reads “Thou
        shalt not suffer a sorceress to live.” In context, the Hebrew word refers not so much to a sorceress as it does
        to a poisoner, and the Hebrew word is so translated in other parts of the Bible. In other words, this was not an
        injunction against Witchcraft, but against murder. The Kabalists knew this. They would welcome their magickally
        oriented brothers and sisters. Also, since Rabbinical Judaism came to the forefront after the destruction of the
        second temple in 70 C.E., religious tolerance has become a Jewish tradition, although some people claim that for
        ultra-orthodox Jews this is becoming less and less the reality today.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Here is a brief series of important dates in the history of
        Witchcraft, with a special focus on Britain and the United States. Some of the dates are approximate.</span>

        Britain and taught the concept of reincarnation. Their religious leaders, the Druids, were solar oriented, and
        major emphasis in worship was placed upon a god. As the Celts and Picts interrelated and intermarried, the god
        and goddess became equally adored. From this union evolved traditions that, in a reconstructed form, are today
        known as Wicca (today commonly pronounced “Wik-ka”). There are other reconstructions that go back to other areas
        of Europe, especially Norse-Germanic and Italian traditions.</span></div>

        and non-Witches. (Ms. Budapest had an occult shop on Lincoln Blvd, just down the street from the Fox Venice

        southern California that closed down after bricks came through the windows, following which the store was
        firebombed. Unfortunately, the true study of Witchcraft and its history, not the lies that have been printed
        about it for hundreds of years, is beyond the scope of this course. Any occult bookstore should be able to
        recommend some good titles for you to begin with if that is your interest.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Low Magick, the magickal system used by Witches, tends to be simple
        and direct. It is neither better nor worse than the High Magick of the ritual magician. It is just different.
        For many people the craft of the Witches is effective, but for others the methods of Kabalistic art magick work
        better. Many people find that the Kabalah appeals to them because people from Western cultures tend to be very
        logic and left-brain oriented. Witches frequently tend to be more right-brain and intuition oriented.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It will be valuable for you to learn one typical system of Low Magick.
        I want to point out that there are literally hundreds of different versions of Witchcraft, and some may do
        something similar to what will be presented later in this lesson, while others may think it bizarre. Witches are
        different all over the world in practice, but many of the basic beliefs are similar or the same. On the next
        pages I will discuss what talismans and amulets are, and a Pagan system for empowering them. Following this I
        will go into the method of making modern Kabalistic talismans. For this, you will need to have your magickal
        tools prepared and consecrated in order to make these talismans into powerful magickal engines.</span></div>

        <span class="bold1">Talismans</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">The word “talisman” is said to come from the Arabic words <span
          class="italic">talis ma</span>, which means “magick writing.” However, there is no proof of this. It may come
        from the Turkish meaning “one who is learned in divinity; a priest.” According to Sandra Tabatha Cicero,
        talisman comes from the Arabic <span class="italic">tilsam</span>, which comes from the Greek <span
          class="italic">telein</span>, meaning “to consecrate,” and <span class="italic">tetelesmenon</span>, meaning
        “that which has been consecrated.” Other sources may be from the Byzantine Greek <span
          class="italic">telesma</span>, meaning a “religious rite,” <span class="italic">telein</span>, meaning
        “perform a religious rite,” or <span class="italic">telos</span>, meaning “completion.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Likewise, the word “amulet,” often used as a synonym for talisman, is
        believed to be of Arabic origin; however, Cicero traces it to the Latin <span class="italic">amuletum</span>,
        which, in turn, is derived from <span class="italic">amolior</span>, meaning “to repel.” That, in turn, may have
        come from the Arabic <span class="italic">amula</span> (a small receptacle used for healing) or <span
          class="italic">hamla</span> (a small object worn for protection). Another source claims it may be related to
        the Latin <span class="italic">amoliri</span>, meaning “to avert.” Again there is no proof. No one knows exactly
        where either word came from.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Today, talismans are used to draw things toward you. Their purposes
        include obtaining money, luck, health, or love. Amulets are used to keep things away. They protect from evil or
        bad luck, and help keep one from ill health. In this course, “talisman” with a lower case first letter will
        refer generically to both Talismans and Amulets. “Talisman” with a capital first letter will refer to an object
        used to draw something to you. “Amulet” with a capitalized first letter will refer to an object used
        specifically to keep something away.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">So far the definitions of these terms has been very general, so let’s
        get into a more precise definition of the term “talisman” from a magickal point of view.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14">
      <div class="calibre19"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">A talisman is . . .</span></span>

                  <br class="calibre5" /><span class="italic">sacred or profane,</span>
                  <br class="calibre5" /><span class="italic">with or without appropriate symbols,</span>
                  <br class="calibre5" /><span class="italic">which had been charged or consecrated by</span>
                  <br class="calibre5" /><span class="italic">appropriate means</span>
                  <br class="calibre5" /><span class="italic">and made to serve a specific end.</span></span></div>
            </div>
          </blockquote>
        </div>
        <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Now let’s analyze this definition. First, a talisman is not simply a
        thought or idea, it must be an object, a physical thing. Second, it can be any object. That means it could be a
        rock or a seashell, a finger ring, or a piece of paper. It doesn’t have to be any form of sacred object,
        although if you had one you wanted to use, it certainly could be a sacred item. It may have words and/or symbols
        on it, but that is not necessary. It must be instilled with magickal energy, either through the process known as
        “consecrating” or through “charging” it. And finally, it needs to have a specific purpose.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">For thousands of years, writing was a magickal art. It was held in
        secret by the privileged classes and magicians. It was believed that certain symbols had magick power in and of
        themselves. This tradition has been carried even into modern movies where Count Dracula cringes in fear at the
        very sight of a cross. Thus, symbols placed upon a rock or piece of parchment were, of themselves, considered to
        be powerful. This is what I call the “animistic” theory of how talismans work. They have a life of their
        own.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Today, many magicians do not believe in this theory. Rather, they take
        what I call the “energetics” theory of how talismans work. They believe that the charging of the talisman is the
        important part; putting magickal energy into the object chosen to be a talisman. The time taken to carefully put
        the proper symbols on the object is a good way to create and send energy. Mix this with the energy raised and
        directed during a ritual to charge the talisman, and it is no wonder that this technique of magick is
        powerful.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Do not doubt that talismans, if properly made and charged, are
        powerful. Here are three instances of which I am personally aware.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre24">
      <div class="calibre25">

            why, she replied that she had been trying to sell her mobile home for six months without luck. She tried
            making a talisman to help her sell her house. The house sold in a few days and she had to prepare to
            move.</span></blockquote>

            taking my class. He asked how the talismans could help him to study and learn for a test he would be having
            in two weeks. I gave him advice on what type of talisman to make. Later, however, I had to give more help.
            He had made a Talisman to gain knowledge and information, but he had charged it improperly and too soon. He
            found that his head was filled with data that had nothing to do with the test he was going to take. I gave
            him some more help and he did very well on the test.</span></blockquote>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As discussed in the previous section of this lesson, practitioners of
        the art of Low Magick were closer in spirit to nature than most of their High Magick practicing counterparts.
        Notice that I used the past tense in the previous sentence. Today, many Low Magicians live in large cities and
        know little of nature’s majesty. Many who call themselves “Witches,” “Wiccans,” or “Pagans” are nothing more
        than people practicing a simplified form of High Magick. However, this in itself should be considered a small
        miracle because as recently as a few decades ago most people who considered themselves to be High Magicians did
        not practice any type of magick. This means that if you practice Magick as described in these lessons you truly
        will be unique, a real practitioner of Art Magick.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Looking back at the Pagans of an earlier time, we see that most if not
        all were in harmony and close communication with nature. They easily saw that all things on this planet were
        composed of four categories. Everything had degrees of hotness or coldness. Perhaps copying the early high
        magicians and alchemists, they came to call this the element “Fire.” Things could also be more or less solid
        (Earth), have varying degrees of fluidity (Water), and various degrees of compactness or expansiveness
        (Air).</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">We have already discussed these four elements. In fact, you should by
        now not only be in harmony with these elements, but you should also have some degree of success in being able to
        control them. Although the main focus in this course is High Magick or ceremonial magick, being able to work
        with the elements is a basis for many forms of magick. To a real magician, terms such as High Magick, Low
        Magick, Art Magick, etc., are terms used only to help others understand what you are doing and to enable you to
        better communicate. To a real magician the important question is not whether it is High or Low, but did it
        work?</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">With this in mind, I want to discuss another disagreement that
        magicians have with another set of people. These people have their minds open to new ideas . . . as long as
        those ideas fall within a surprisingly narrow set of belief patterns. No, I am not talking about religious
        fanatics. I’m talking about some scientists. As stated before, many scientists tend to scoff at this “simple”
        fourfold division of matter. Modern science points to its own periodic table of the elements and says, “we can
        prove the existence of over 115 elements.” This, according to the modern scientist, makes the old four-element
        theory obsolete superstition.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Nonsense!</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The four-element (really five-element) theory does not define
        “element” the same way modern science does. The four elements define the properties of matter, not its chemical
        makeup. Gold is an element in the modern scientific sense. In the four-element theory (or perhaps four-quality
        theory would be a better phrase), gold has relative amounts of Fire, Air, Earth, and Water. Therefore, both the
        ancient four-element theory and the modern scientific theory of the elements can coexist with no problem so long
        as you understand that the word “element” has a different meaning for scientists and for magicians. I feel that
        it is important to understand these differences, which is why I have represented this material at this
        time.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">You have probably heard of a person obtaining the lock of another
        person’s hair to use as a basis for casting a “spell” upon the person from whom the lock of hair was taken. The
        hair does not merely represent the person from whom it was taken, but is actually said to be “in sympathy” with
        that person. Here the word “sympathy” has the earlier, somewhat archaic meaning of “being closely related” and
        not the modern meaning of “feeling sorry for someone” or “having similar feeling or emotions as another person.”
        That is the reason that this type of spellcasting is frequently called “sympathetic magick.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Other things could be used to represent and be in sympathy with
        another person. A picture, a piece of clothing, parings from the person’s fingernails or toenails, a drawing, or
        a doll could all be used to relate to the person. Expanding on this, we can find that there are many things that
        could correspond to a person. It is in this way that lists of correspondences can be set up, as was the list of
        Kabalistic correspondences given in an earlier lesson.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The four elements have correspondences, too. Here is a list of some
        possible correspondences.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">AIR</span>: A feather; incense; the colors blue,
        white, or gold.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">EARTH</span>: A rock; pentacles in the Tarot; the
        colors brown, black, or green.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">FIRE</span>: A piece of coal, a match, the color
        red or reddish-orange.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">WATER</span>: A pebble found near or in water; a
        shell; the colors blue, black, or green.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Notice that in the above short list there is duplication in the use of
        colors corresponding to the elements. This is not a mistake. Rather, it allows you to choose which system of
        color correspondences you wish to use.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Just as in the above list certain objects correspond to one of the
        four elements, so, too, can the elements relate to a variety of ideas, as is shown below:</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">AIR</span>: Schooling, memory, intellectualism,
        teaching, tests, divination, communications, travel, writing, organizing and organizations, groups of all kinds,
        theorizing, drug addiction.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">EARTH</span>: Money, jobs, promotions, business,
        investments, material objects, fertility, agriculture, health foods, ecology, conservation, stock market,
        antiques, old age, museums, buildings, construction, progress, the home, the physical world, daily necessities
        such as food and clothing.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">FIRE</span>: Success, sex, passion, banishing some
        illnesses, military, conflicts, protection, courts, law, police and sheriff’s agencies, contests, competitions,
        private detectives, dowsing, treasure hunting, gambling, athletics, strength, good health, war, terrorism, and
        on a more personal level anything related to the Freudian “id,” the lower emotions of absurd desire and lust
        (that is, too much desire or lust), anger, violent emotions. Also things having speed.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">WATER</span>: Higher forms of love and the deeper
        emotions such as compassion, faith, loyalty, and devotion. Also friendship, partnerships, unions of any kind,
        affection, contract negotiation, beauty, rest, recuperation, meditation, spirituality, healing wounds, restoring
        growth, childbirth and children, the home, receptivity, family, swimming, diving, fishing, ancestors, medicine,
        hospitals, compassion, doctors and nursing, clairvoyance.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Notice that a few of the listings above seem duplicated, appearing in
        more than one of the four elemental categories. As an example, the home is listed under Earth and Water. Again,
        this is not an error. Here it allows you to more closely define the terms. Under the element Earth, the home
        refers to a structure, the building wherein you live. Under the element of Water, the home refers to the
        qualities of home life: love, stability, support, etc.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">You could probably add many other ideas to this list as a result of
        your working with the elements over the last few months. This is highly advisable. What you might do is start
        keeping a small book with precise definitions of what the elements represent to you. Use the above list as a
        starting point and expand upon it. And no, the above list is not written in stone as immutable law in some dank
        cave in the Himalayas. So, if you want to remove something from the above list or place it under another
        element, follow the motto of frontiersman, soldier, and politician Davy Crockett (1786-1836): “Make sure you’re
        right . . . then go ahead.” With the above information you now have a system for the making of talismans.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Do you need help with a test? Make a Talisman of Air. Do you need more
        love? Make a Talisman of Water. Is there too much anger and violent emotions in your family life? Make an Amulet
        of Fire. If you need more money, a Talisman of Earth should do the trick.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Now that you know on which element to base the talisman you wish to
        construct, the next question is “What is the first step for constructing a Low Magick talisman?” Whether you are
        doing Low Magick, High Magick, or any other Magick, if you are doing something to affect yourself or someone
        else on this plane, that is, if you are doing Grey Magick, <span class="italic">ALWAYS begin by doing a
          divination!</span> I cannot stress this sufficiently.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">One law that everything in our world must live by is the law most
        commonly called karma, the law of cause and effect. Every action that you take has its own consequences which
        will come upon you whether you are prepared for them or not. Many practitioners of Low Magick tend to go one
        step further than the “as you sow, so shall ye reap” idea of karma. They say that whatever you do will be
        returned to you threefold. This threefold law states that if you do something good, you will be rewarded with a
        similar amount of good three times over. However, do something negative and you will be “rewarded” with three
        times as much bad coming your way. And karma is carried over from one life to the next. Suicide or death does
        not expiate karma.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Suppose you want to leave the country and need lots of money to do so.
        You make a Talisman to get the money. Then you learn that your parents have been in an accident and died,
        leaving you a large inheritance. You have done Grey Magick and helped yourself on the physical plane by getting
        the money. But your Talisman may have been responsible for the deaths of your parents, so your magick was
        definitely of the blackest kind.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Karma is <span class="italic">amoral</span>, meaning it has no
        morality. It is perfectly and totally just. There are no exceptions to the law of karma any more than there are
        exceptions to the law of gravity. If you do Black Magick, whether or not you originally intended it to be Black,
        you will, sooner or later, pay for it. I am therefore urging you <span class="italic">never</span> to do Black
        Magick. I do so not on any moral grounds (although I am ethically against Black Magick), but for
        self-protection.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In the above case, the talismanist had no way of knowing whether or
        not the Grey Magick would become Black. What should have been done first, therefore, was a divination to see
        whether or not it would be a good idea to do the talisman, and what the outcome would be. By doing this you can
        protect yourself from accidentally doing Black Magick and having to suffer the consequences.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The next step in making a Low Magick talisman is to find an
        appropriate object to use for the talisman. Given just before the above correspondences for the four elements
        are different objects that can be used for the making of talismans associated with the elements. However, any
        object may be used. A rock painted red can represent Fire. A necklace or ring can also be used.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Put a coin in your refrigerator for an hour. Take it out with your
        left hand and hold it for a few moments. Now put it in your right hand. You will find, of course, that the coin
        has gotten warmer than it was when you removed it from the refrigerator. The coin has been infused with energy
        in the form of heat. Likewise, virtually anything in this world has been infused with various types and
        quantities of psychic energies. Perhaps you have gone on a vacation and been in an utterly magnificent hotel
        room. Yet that room may have felt “cold” and uncomfortable compared to your far less luxurious home. This is
        because your psychic energies have not infused the room as they have your home. This is why, even if your home
        is a “dump” and crawling with bugs, it still can feel like home. You would have to live in a place for days,
        weeks, or even months before a new house or apartment really becomes your home.</span></div>

          <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
          <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">You should never do Black Magick. Not even accidentally. That’s
              what I wrote in the first edition of <span class="italic">Modern Magick</span>. That’s what I believed.
              That’s what I’ve taught. However, as my understanding of karma (Tee-koon) has evolved, my position on this
              has had to evolve, too.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As I have described, karma is completely based on actions, not
              intent. It doesn’t matter that an accident resulting in your harming someone else was unintended. You did
              it. You get the karma for it. It’s that simple. Deal with it.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">But there is something unique that happens as you grow and
              evolve as a magician: rules aren’t simply rules you follow because, well, because they’re the rules.
              Rather, you follow them because you understand them. You understand karma.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">For example, if I violently harm someone, I get the karma for my
              action. That’s simple and direct. But now let me give you a little scenario ...</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I’m walking to my house, and I hear screams. I go to
              investigate. A man is raping a woman. I tell him to stop. He ignores me. I push him away. He just pushes
              back and continues his ugly attack on the woman.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I know that the next step will be to stop him through the use of
              physical harm to him. Causing physical harm will result in my accruing “negative” karma. It’s a form of
              Black Magick (although understood by Western science) that’s not even accidental. If I act with violence,
              I’ll be committing Black Magick.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">So what should I do? Call for help and avoid the unwanted karmic
              result of my actions?</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Sorry. No chance. I’m just a human and far from perfect. If it’s
              necessary to harm that person to prevent a rape, I would do it without worrying about the karmic
              consequences for me. I wouldn’t give it a second thought. In my imperfect way I would do what I feel I
              have to do and feel not a single drop of remorse.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">So, if you’re still around during my next lifetime and I come
              back as a skunk or a rock, please, take advantage of me and make me useful so I can once again evolve
              spiritually.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Karma is perfectly just. But sometimes, as a human, I may need
              to tell karma to go to Hell as I consciously choose to do something that will incur unwanted karma. That’s
              okay. I can live with it. Again and again, if need be.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">So in some instances I’ll choose to do what I believe right for
              the greatest number of people and for our planet, even if it’s karmically regressive for me.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Even small objects pick up psychic charges from their environment.
        Therefore, before using any object as a talisman, it must first be purified and cleansed of any known or unknown
        charge of psychic energy.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This is easy to do. Hold the object to be used as a talisman under
        running water. For this purpose you can use water coming out of a sink faucet or a garden hose, or, more
        traditionally, a stream. Hold it there for about three minutes while you visualize all energies within the
        object flowing out of it with the water. Do not use the waves of the ocean for this purpose, as the waves keep
        coming back and would return to the object you have chosen the energies you wished to cleanse.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If the object will not last well under flowing water, bury it in the
        ground for at least a half hour, preferably overnight. Our Mother Earth has a natural ability to “ground” out

        your daily newspaper. Usually near either the weather section or the sport fishing section you will find some
        rather silly looking drawings of the “Man in the Moon.” These will tell the dates of the full, new, and quarter

        prefer to work “skyclad,” that is, wearing only the sky: nude. While this does cut down on clothing bills and
        cleaning expenses, it can also cause a problem (due to prying neighbors) for those who wish to work outside in
        their backyard. If you cannot work skyclad, or would feel strange or inhibited working without clothes, then by
        all means do wear your special magickal clothes or robe.</span></div>

              Pagans have simply adopted selections of their old belief systems into their Paganism. One of these sets
              of ideas was Christian morality, which portrayed the naked body as evil.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Today, a surprisingly large number of people who identify
              themselves as Pagans have adopted this belief. I’ve seen some posts online where people boldly declare
              that Pagans never worshipped skyclad. Others could not conceive of themselves being naked in front of
              others, showing that they don’t understand the concept of being skyclad to honor the Goddess and/or have
              issues over body image and other insecurities.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">While some people who have been Pagans for a long time feel sad
              about this change, it is what has happened. Trying to fight evolution is like trying to hold back the
              tides with a bucket rife with holes. The effort may feel good, but the results are nil. Perhaps it’s
              better just to accept a simple truism: <span class="italic"><span class="bold">What is,

        yourself and your area. Visualize a brilliant white (some say violet) light coming from the ends of the
        universe, going through the top of your head and down through your feet into the Earth. As it does so, realize
        that this pure light is taking with it all problems and impurities that may have been within you and are on your
        mind either consciously or unconsciously. Next, visualize a bright white light forming a ring about your
        now-purified self, at chest height. Now see in your mind’s eye the expansion of this light of pure white
        brilliance so that it forms a circle around you three, five, seven, or nine feet in diameter. The size depends
        upon the space available to you. Finally, this circle should expand up and down so that you are surrounded
        above, below, behind, and to the front with a sphere of white light. You should be in the center of a brilliant

        possibilities. People who use Kabalistic methods while decrying Kabalism should seek to enhance their knowledge
        or discover the motive for their hypocrisy.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP TWO.</span> After purifying and clearing
        your circle, the next step is to “Grab the Moon.” What you do is take the essence of the magickal nature of the
        Moon (the Goddess aspect of Divinity) into your hands and place that nature into the talisman. At the same time
        you charge the nature of the Moon with the purpose of the talisman. To Grab the Moon we use the gesture known as
        the “Triangle of Manifestation” which is described earlier in this course. To refresh your memory, this action
        is made by holding both hands flat with the thumbs extended at sixty degrees from the fingers. Place the tips of
        the thumbs together and tips of the first fingers of each hand together. This will form a triangle with the
        thumbs as the base line and the first fingers forming the sides. See the illustration below.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Now hold up this Triangle of Manifestation so that you can see the
        Moon surrounded by the triangle. If you are in a place where you cannot see the Moon, visualize the Moon within
        the triangle. In a short time there will seem to be two moons. The real (or visualized) Moon will have a second
        moon next to it. It will appear slightly to the side or “out of phase” with the original Moon. This second moon
        is the essence of the Moon’s magickal power. It is possible that you may not be able to see this second moon,
        but <span class="italic">knowing beyond the slightest doubt</span> that it is there will suffice.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP THREE</span>. In this step you do two things
        at once. While concentrating on that second moon, slowly bring your hands down toward the object you are using
        for the talisman. Try to keep the second moon’s image within the triangle (or know that it is there) and, in
        your mind, mentally repeat over and over a single word or short phrase that best represents the purpose of the
        talisman. As an example, the word “health” could be used to represent “I wish to get over this cold and regain
        my health.” Limit any phrase to no more than four words.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As you do these things, bring your hands over, then down around the
        talisman. The goal is to surround the talisman with the triangle formed by your hands. The energy of the Moon,
        impregnated by your will for the purpose of the talisman, is now joining with the object.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">In a few seconds you should experience a new sensation. Some people describe it as a sudden
        lightness in the hands. Others describe it as a rush of energy or a snapping sensation. Everyone experiences
        this sensation somewhat differently, so I can’t give an exact description. However, as soon as you experience
        the change, clap your hands or snap your fingers. Then, as you separate your hands, say,<div class="calibre20">

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">What has happened here is that the Goddess energies of the Moon, mixed

        own words to thank the powers of the universe who have aided you in this ritual and bid them depart to “their
        homes and habitations.” Write the results of your ritual in your magickal or ritual diary.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">When you have achieved the goal of the talisman, the object needs to
        be discharged of any remaining energy. This can be done by holding it under water or burying it as before. It
        can then be reused as a talisman for another purpose. If possible, and if the object is disposable (and
        biodegradable), destroy the object by burning it to ash and getting rid of the ash in the air (by throwing it)
        or into water. Or, just put it into running water or bury it where it will not be found.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">You may charge several talismans for the same purpose at one time.
        However, it is not a good idea to try to energize several talismans for different purposes (even if they’re
        associated with the same magickal element) at the same time or even during the same ritual. Focus on one thing
        at a time.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">When using a talisman it is a good idea to keep it on you or near you.
        If you are making the talisman for someone else, tell him or her to keep the talisman on or near their body. Of
        course, you should ask the person’s permission before making the talisman or giving it to him or her. Do not,
        however, tell the person the intricacies of the ritual and of the construction of the talisman. Tell the person
        to whom you give the talisman to destroy the object or return it to you once the talisman has achieved its
        purpose.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The unconscious mind does not think in negatives. Don’t make a
        talisman to “stop smoking.” Rather, make one to be “free of smoking.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As described in the sidebar earlier in this lesson, it is a good idea
        to make the goals of your talisman SMART goals. Therefore, it is desirable to put a time limit on your talisman.
        In your charging have it planned to achieve its goal in one week or one month or by a certain date. Even if you
        do not achieve the goal by that date, be sure to purify or destroy the talisman at that time. Then wait two more
        weeks to see if a result is forthcoming. Sometimes talismans get things started but not completed by their time
        limit. If you don’t notice a result two weeks after the functionality of the talisman has ended, go back over
        your magickal diary, analyze what you might have done wrong, and start over. Chemicals, under the same
        conditions, always react with each other in the same way. If they do not, the mistake was made by the
        experimenter. Likewise, magick always works. If not, you have made some error. It is interesting to note that
        while scientists will readily accept the statement regarding chemistry, some will attempt to refute the similar
        statement regarding magick. In this case, logic is on our side, not theirs.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Once you have charged your talisman, don’t think about it. Your
        unconscious plays an important part in the magickal process. Constantly bringing the aspect of the mind that
        connects us to the astral plane down to the physical world will lower the effectiveness of your magickal work.

        home, use several small statues (or even colorful rocks) overlooking each entry. Scott Cunningham used toy
        dinosaurs for this purpose. He had them by the door and the windows of the apartment. It was in one of the most

    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Now we turn our attention back to Kabalistic magick. As you have seen
        from the last section, making and charging a talisman using a Pagan system such as the one just presented is
        direct and fairly easy. There is little you have to prepare. You will find that the Kabalistic system takes more
        time and thought to construct a talisman. To me it makes a Kabalistic talisman more precise. I personally enjoy
        that precision and necessary mind-work. My personal experience indicates that a Kabalistic talisman, once
        charged, may take a little longer to achieve its effect, but that effect can be far more intense than a Low
        Magick talisman. I am inclined to believe, however, that this is due to my own predilection for the Kabalah. In
        all probability, the Kabalistic talisman is neither more nor less effective than one made using Low Magick. The
        difference is based upon the person who does the actual work. Also note that although the Kabalistic talisman
        takes more time and effort to create than does a Pagan talisman, it is not more difficult to construct. It just
        takes some more thought and creativity. If you follow the instructions given here you will have no problem in
        the construction and charging of a Kabalistic talisman.</span></div>

        <span class="bold1">A Bit of History</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Before the destruction of the second Temple in 70 C.E., many
        Kabalistic (or pre-Kabalistic) talismans were made of precious metals which could hang as a pendant on a chain
        or be attached to clothes. But the most common type of talisman from that time was a long, narrow scroll of
        parchment. Some of these have been found which were about two inches wide and twenty-two inches long. This
        scroll was literally covered with writing. In fact, the ancient Kabalistic talismanists frequently used
        abbreviations to allow for more meaning on the strip of parchment than straightforward writing would allow. This
        was then rolled up and placed in a leather, cloth, or metal (usually silver) container.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In E. A. Wallis Budge’s <span class="italic">Amulets and
          Talismans,</span> the author describes a “perfect” Kabalistic talisman. Of course, no such talisman ever
        existed. Budge examined many ancient Kabalistic talismans and listed what was common to most of them. In a
        similar manner, musicologists examined all of Johann Sebastian Bach’s fugues and, with the help of a computer,
        came up with an “ideal” Bach fugue. However, when comparing the computer’s ideal with Bach’s actual
        compositions, they discovered that none of Bach’s fugues perfectly matched the ideal.</span></div>

      <div class="calibre19">The early Kabalists did not create their mystic system from out of the air, no matter how
        romantic that idea may seem. Although the ancient Kabalistic talismans were particularly Hebraic in nature, much
        of what was done was based on earlier Pagan ideas. Thus, early Kabalistic talismans were not as specific as the
        ones made today. In fact, there were only about six reasons for making ancient Kabalistic talismans:<div
          class="calibre24">
          <div class="calibre25">
            <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">1. For generally beneficial and benedictory

      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As I have said before, the Kabalah is not something static and
        unchanging. It has evolved over the past several thousand years. These changes allow us to have a far wider
        variety of topics and deep precision in choosing the purpose for making our talisman. Also, it allows us to
        almost “fill in the spaces” according to a simple system once we know the purpose of the talisman we wish to
        construct.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">First, we do not have to worry about the choice of an object to
        charge. Although precious metals were sometimes used, for eons the object of choice to use as a Kabalistic
        talisman has been a piece of virgin parchment. Parchment was so strong that it could be washed and used for
        writing over and over. Thus a used piece of parchment could carry with it various psychic energies that would be
        unwanted. Virgin (unused) parchment solved this problem. It was also easy to destroy once it had achieved its
        goal.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Today, real parchment is very expensive and hard to find. Imitation
        parchment is readily available at most stationery stores. If you are a purist, some occult stores do carry the
        real thing, which is made of the skin of sheep or goats.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">But why, other than for tradition, should you use parchment? In the
        ancient Middle East, wood and paper made from wood pulp was a fairly scarce commodity. Parchment was a sturdy
        and re-usable writing surface. It was an early, standard form of paper. For today’s magicians there is nothing
        wrong with using plain, white, unused, and unrecycled paper, except for aesthetic reasons. So, if you wish, you
        can use imitation parchment from a stationery store or even real parchment from an occult supply store. In this
        course I will be referring to the object upon which we will be making Kabalistic talismans as “paper,” for paper
        will do just fine.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">We will not be using a long scroll of paper. Modern Kabalistic
        talismans are much smaller and packed with more symbolism than their predecessors. If you cut out a piece of
        paper so that it is two inches by four inches and fold it in half, you will find that there are four squares:
        two on the front and two on the back, each exactly two inches by two inches. Each of these four squares is going
        to be filled with words and symbols. But where will we find them? Obviously, many will come in some way from the
        Tree of Life, the main symbol of the Kabalah. But how is this done?</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">On page 266 you will find a list of possible wants or desires
        associated with each Sephira. Read over the chart and see how various ideas relate to the ten Sephiroht. If
        something is not on the list, you can expand on the ideas list for each Sephira. Can you see, for example, how
        football would be related to Giburah? Or can you understand how poetry is related more to Netzach than to
        Hode?</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">Let us say, for example, we wish to create a talisman to obtain a really good friendship.
        By going over the chart we can see that this would relate to Tiferet. Now check back to your list of Kabalistic
        correspondences given in Lesson Three. From that page can be obtained the following list of items that can be
        put on the talisman. All of these words and items are associated with the Sephira Tiferet:<div

                  class="italic">Selah</span>?</span></span></div>
          <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
          <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">The word <span class="italic">Selah</span> has puzzled scholars
              for over two thousand years. Its meaning is completely questionable, even though it appears seventy-one
              times in the book of Psalms (and three times in the book of Habakkuk).</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Worship in the Temple of Jerusalem was an impressive and joyous
              event, not some dour and ultra-serious, monotone of rote repetition. Worship included large choirs and
              even an orchestra. This may lead to a clue as to the meaning of Selah.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The psalms were not meant to be read; they were meant to be
              sung. Therefore, some scholars believe that Selah was a musical instruction. It may have indicated a
              dramatic pause or an indication of the volume of the chorus being raised . . . or lowered. It has also
              been suggested that it indicates when a new melody is introduced or as a signal for an instrumental
              crescendo or diminuendo, an increase or decrease in volume. So how the heck did that get on to a
              talisman?</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">One of the most popular translations of Selah into English is
              “forever.” If that is correct it could have a meaning similar to AMEN, and therefore, because God is a
              faithful king, he will keep his word and empower the talisman. Another version that might even be closer
              is that it means “let there be [made].” That makes even more sense to me. It’s like saying “Here is my
              talisman. Let it be made properly.”</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">One scholar simply suggests that it marks a transition from one
              thought to another. Another suggestion is that it is a cue for people to join in singing, meaning “lift up
              your voices.” Another scholar suggests that it means “this sentence really doesn’t belong here.” It may
              also be an abbreviation for several words or a corruption of some word.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">A Jewish music expert suggests it simply stresses the importance
              of what went before it. One commentator said this is where the congregation would prostrate itself before
              God.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">One Christian commentator, Tony Warren, suggests it means “to
              hang” with the implication of weighing and measuring to determine value. Thus, it means “valued.”</span>
          </div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Certainly saying that what came before on a talisman is valued
              makes a lot of sense. Unfortunately, all of these suggested meanings are nothing more than logical
              guesses. Until something that more clearly identifies the meaning of Selah comes along, we can just live
              with its sonorous sound.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This is a large list. But there are even more things which we can use.
        For instance, we can come up with a numerical representation through one or both of two systems of numerology.
        Here is the most common system used today. It is known as the Pythagorean system.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre2"><img alt="136" src="images/000170.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>

      <div class="calibre19">As you can see, the letters “a,” “j,” and “s” are listed under and equal the number 1; the
        letters “b,” “k,” and “t” equal 2, and so forth. For our talisman, let’s use the keyword “friendship” and figure
        out its numerical value according to the chart on the previos page:<div class="calibre2"><img alt="137"

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Here you can see that Theosophical Reduction must be done twice to

        numbers” in detail.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In this more Kabalistic system above we have determined that the value
        of the word (and idea of) friendship is 1. We can add 1 to our list.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The reason this is a more Kabalistic system of numerology is because
        the values of the English letters are determined by associating them with the numbers of the Hebrew letters with
        which they sound identical. Thus, the Hebrew letter “Gimel” is related to the English letter “g.” Since the
        Gimel equals 3, in this system the English “g” also equals 3. The Yud is associated with the English letters “i”
        and “y,” and, according to some people, “j.” Thus, these letters are associated with the number 10, the number
        associated with Yud. By Theosophical Reduction they become related to the number 1. Other possible associations,
        because they have several possible correspondences with Hebrew, have been moved to those numbers deemed
        appropriate.</span></div>

        so that we can literally get a symbol that looks like an “X” repeated four times and jammed together. Your
        conscious mind, at some time in the future, might not realize that this symbol means “woman,” but your
        unconscious mind will remember and act on it without the conscious getting in the way.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Note, too, that the letters in the “friendship” example are made
        angular and may be turned sideways, as with the “p,” or exaggerated as with the evolution of the “r.” If you use
        a little imagination you can get a nice, artistic, and somewhat complex symbol to add to our list representing
        the concept of “friendship.”</span></div>
    <h2 class="calibre29"><span class="calibre30">
        <span class="bold1">The System of the Hermetic Rose Cross</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Another system you can use to make symbols for use on your talisman is
        based on the illustration shown on the next page. It is the center of a cross filled with elaborate symbols used
        by the Golden Dawn and known as the Hermetic Rose Cross. The three circles of Hebrew letters are based on a
        description of Hebrew found in the <span class="italic">Sepher Yetzirah</span>. The three letters in the center
        are called the “mother letters,” and the represent the three elements (remember, it has a system where the four
        elements came from three). The middle circle is composed of seven letters, representing the seven days, the
        seven lower Sephiroht, etc. They’re called “double letters” because each one traditionally had two forms, one of
        which was used at the beginning or within words, while the other was used at the end of words. The outer circle
        has twelve letters, representing the signs of the zodiac. They’re called “single letters” because they have only
        one form.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre2"><img alt="141" src="images/000095.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In the version of this glyph shown in the next column, the Hebrew is
        transliterated into English, making it easier for non-Hebrew readers to use. You will notice that in some of the
        boxes, there are multiple English letters. This is because there is no direct transliteration between the two
        languages, and some Hebrew letters have multiple sounds. Thus, the Vahv is transliterated as “V,” “O,” and “U.”
        The Peh is transliterated as “P,” “Ph,” and “F.” You will also note that some English sounds are associated with
        multiple letters such as the English “K.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">To use this glyph to make mystic symbols, simply lay a piece of thin
        paper over the figure. Draw a small circle in the section where you find the first letter of the word that you
        wish to symbolize. From that circle, draw a straight line to the space with the second letter of the word.
        Continue with this pattern until you have completed the word. Draw a short line across the end of the figure to
        indicate the end of the word. If you have any double letters in your word, simply draw a loop back to the same
        section as indicated in the example immediately below for the word “Happy.” When you have a situation where
        there are multiple locations for a letter on the image, choose whichever design you believe looks most
        aesthetically pleasing. Remove the tracing paper from the Hermetic Rose Cross and you will have your symbolic
        design as shown for “Happy.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre2"><img alt="142" src="images/000081.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>

    <div class="calibre13">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">It is okay to have lines cross over each other. See the example on the next page: <div
          class="calibre2"><img alt="144" src="images/000052.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>
        <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>

        <div class="calibre5"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></span></div>
        <div class="calibre13">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Notice that in the above two samples, for the words “happy” and
        “friendship” I have shown that the symbol, once designed and understood, may have any dimensions. Thus we have
        another symbol, which can be added to our list of items that can be used to make a talisman.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">With what we have thus far it is possible to design quite a nice
        talisman for friendship. All we need to do is fill up the four squares of our piece of paper with selections
        from our list. You do not have to use all of the selections from the list, nor should you be limited by the
        contents of the list.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">On the next page is an example drawn from the list we have created. On
        side one we see a heart, the letter “Vahv,” plus the letter name spelled out. We also see the words “Ruach” and
        “intellect.” Again, all of these ideas are from the list we have compiled.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">On the second side we see that the whole side has been shaded golden
        yellow. In the center is the astrological symbol for the Sun, a circle with a dot at the center. Also on this
        side is the God name, YHVH El-oh-ah V’dah-aht, and the name of the archangel Raphael, who is the Divine
        Physician.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">On side three is the name of the Sephira, Tiferet, and its meaning,
        which is “beauty.” On either side is found the name of the order of angels, the Malacheem that means
        “Messengers.” In the center is the symbol derived from the system of A. O. Spare.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Finally, on side four are seen the numerological values of the word
        “friendship” and the symbol drawn from the center of the Hermetic Rose Cross.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre2"><img alt="145" src="images/000039.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It is not necessary to make your talismans absolutely perfect works of
        art. Merely draw your best and put all of your energies into the construction of the talisman and you will be
        successful.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In the next lesson you will learn how to make your piece of paper with
        symbols on it change into a powerful magickal tool. To do so you will also need something in which to place the
        talisman once it is charged. The easiest way to do this is by getting a felt square of the color appropriate to
        the Sephira with which you are working. In this case, yellow or gold would be the correct color. Take the square
        and cut out a piece three inches by five inches. Fold it in half and staple or sew up two of the open sides. You
        will have a container that is the right size and into which the charged talisman may be slipped. Don’t sew or
        staple the top until after you have placed the talisman inside! A string may also be attached so that it can be
        worn as a necklace under your clothes.</span></div>
    <h2 class="calibre29"><span class="calibre30">
        <span class="bold1">Pay Attention to This Secret!</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">It is important for you to understand that you cannot learn magick by
        just reading. It takes practice, study, and thinking. If you have not reread, studied, and thought about the
        previous lessons in this course, you should do so immediately.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As you do so, please remember Dion Fortune’s position that there is no
        room for authority in occultism. As I like to say, “Don’t take my word for it. Check it out yourself.”</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Some writers on the occult will warn you against following
        instructions in some books because they contain “blinds” with false information to make sure that those who are
        unwary will not have luck in their magick. So now, I have a secret to reveal. I have purposely included one such
        blind. It is the only such blind in this book.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The truth is, however, that if you have been reviewing this book as I
        have consistently suggested, you should have discovered it already. If you paid attention to the information,
        you would have seen that the Hebrew spelling of the archangelic names used on the elemental weapons <span
          class="italic">always ends with the letter known as the Lahmed</span>. Since this has an “1” sound, and
        archangelic names on all of the tools end with the syllable “-el,” this should be obvious. Now look back to
        Lesson Three where instructions are given on the symbols for the pentacle. The Hebrew spelling of Auriel is
        missing the Lahmed.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Did you catch this as you studied your lessons and think it was a
        typographical error? If so, congratulations! You are well on the way to being a thinking, competent
        magician.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If not, do not feel bad nor despair. If this had been meant to be a
        trick or a trap I would not have revealed it. Rather, it is a simple lesson that is better learned here than
        during the performance of a magickal rite! It is important to be certain that everything you are doing and using
        is correct.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">So go over and restudy the lessons up to this point. Don’t just read
        them. Think about them, question them, take the logic presented in them to the limit, and see where it takes you
        or if it breaks down. In this way you can become an excellent, fearless, powerful magician.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">On your pentacle, you should correct your Hebrew by simply adding the additional Lahmed at
        the end of the name. Auriel looks like this:<div class="calibre2"><img alt="146" src="images/000026.jpg"
            class="calibre11" /></div>
        <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Or does it? The Resh and Dallet look very similar. The Zy-in and the
        Vahv look alike, too. But you’ve come so far. Don’t get paranoid and start doubting yourself. Just remember ol’
        Davy Crockett: “Make sure you’re right . . . then go ahead.”</span></div>
    <h2 class="calibre29"><span class="calibre30">
        <span class="bold1">Supplement to Lesson Seven</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">At this time some of you may be thinking that the information I have
        presented to you on Kabalistic talismans is incomplete. Why didn’t I mention that the numeral 6 could also be
        used for the friendship talisman, as Tiferet is the sixth Sephira? And what about all those other talismans one
        can see in books and for sale in occult shops that look nothing like the talismans I have described?</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">These are fair questions, for which I have two answers. First, the
        ancient Kabalists made individualized talismans, not mass-produced items. In fact, some were so individualized
        that various abbreviated Hebrew inscriptions cannot be interpreted even after years of study. Certainly you
        could copy designs from other sources. But the work and time spent in the designing of your personal talisman is
        Kabalistically and magickally important. Just the work of designing and creating the talisman adds energy and
        focus to it. Also, many of the pre-fab talismans have been mutilated and changed over the centuries, making
        their validity questionable.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Second, and more importantly, this course is meant to be an
        introduction to ceremonial magick, not the final word. As stated in an earlier lesson, a goal of this course is
        to allow you to pick up any book on magick, read it, and have enough understanding of it to use what is in the
        book. (I have to add that over the past several decades some highly advanced magick books have been published
        that are tremendously difficult for those who do not understand specialized meanings of keywords. But, being
        very advanced, it would not be a good idea to start off with them, anyway.) I have numerous books on talismans,
        and to present all of the information in those books, all of the sigils, symbols, and ideas, would take hundreds
        of pages. If I added the history of those symbols along with their derivation and meanings, it might take up
        thousands of pages. That simply is not the purpose of these lessons.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">However, I think it only fair to present to you in supplement some
        other symbolic systems for representing planetary influences. Yes, it will be incomplete, but it will show you
        from where they are derived. If you want, feel free to include them in your talisman making.</span></div>
    <h2 class="calibre29"><span class="calibre30">
        <span class="bold1">The Olympian Spirits of the</span>
        <span class="italic1"><span class="bold1">Arbatel of Magick</span></span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14">
      <div class="calibre19">The book the <span class="italic">Arbatel of Magick</span> is extremely rare today. It was
        first published in Latin in 1575 at Basle, and published for the first time in English in London in 1655. It is
        supposed to contain nine sections, but only one remains (or ever existed). It is known as “Isagogue,” or “A Book
        of the Institutions of Magick.” In this work, which is introductory in nature, are given the so-called “Olympian
        Spirits,” each with its own “character” or symbol. There have been a few different versions of symbols
        associated with the names of these spirits. In the previous edition I gave one of them. After a great deal of
        research and thought, I have come to the conclusion that the version I gave was not the earliest version, and
        therefore not what I would consider the most accurate. Below is a version that I now consider to be the most
        accurate listing of their names, symbols, and the planets to which they correspond:<div class="calibre2"><img
            alt="147" src="images/000013.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>
        <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">Other symbols you can use on your talisman include the astrological symbols of the planets
        and their number (which is the same as the number of the Sephira) as follows:<div class="calibre2"><img
            alt="148" src="images/000092.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>
        <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Notice that there is no planet associated with numbers 1 and 2. This
        is because the first two Sephiroht are associated with what is called the “first swirlings” (the “Big Bang”?)
        and the belt of the zodiac. Some modern Kabalists do equate these with the outer planets, but this is debatable
        and in my opinion there is still too much disagreement to change to anything other than the ancient sources as
        given here.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">You can also see that the “Talismanic Magick” chart does not include
        the tenth Sephira. This is related to the planet Earth and to the magickal elements of which our planet is
        composed. It is not needed for our system of talisman making.</span></div>

      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14">
      <div class="calibre19">It would also be appropriate to cut your talisman into a shape with the number of sides
        matching the number of the Sephira or planet. The square design is always appropriate as is the circular design
        with a hinge, as shown below. This design looks like a locket:<div class="calibre2"><img alt="149"
            src="images/000080.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>

    </div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">In a similar fashion, an appropriate shape for a Saturn- or Binah-oriented talisman
        (related to the number 3) is the triangular locket design shown on the next page: <div class="calibre2"><img

        <span class="bold1">The Geomantic Key to Talismanic Symbolism</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Geomancy is an ancient divinatory art with similarities to the I
        Ching. Originally, dots were made at random with a pointed stick in the soil. The number of these dots was then
        totaled. If the sum was even, two dots were made to the side. If the number was odd, only one dot was used. A
        figure made up of four lines of either one or two dots was thus created.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This process was then repeated several times followed by more patterns
        synthesized from combinations of the original patterns. Finally, all of these figures were placed on a horoscope
        chart and interpreted according to a set of rules.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">When first learning geomancy, it appears complex and difficult.
        Actually, one becomes quite facile at it with just a few hours of practice. The rules of geomancy are available
        in several books, including <span class="italic">The Golden Dawn</span> by Israel Regardie and <span
          class="italic">The Equinox</span> by Aleister Crowley.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Each geomantic figure is related to a particular planet. By playing
        “connect the dots” with the figure you can make a series of designs related to the planets and based on the
        geomantic symbols. This subject is too complex to discuss fully here, but I want to give you an idea of what the
        symbols look like so you will recognize them in talismans you may see in various pieces of literature and on
        pre-fab talismans.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The figure in the next column is the Geomantic figure known as <span
          class="italic">Carcer</span> (“kahr-sehr”). It is associated with Saturn in its rulership of Capricorn:</span>

      <div class="calibre19">By connecting the dots you can make a variety of designs, including any of these figures:

        <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">When used on talismans they might be used singly or in groups, as shown in the samples
        below:<div class="calibre2"><img alt="154" src="images/000171.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>

    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">The geomantic figure known as <span class="italic">Acquisitio</span> (“Akkwih-seet-ee-yoh”)
        represents Jupiter ruling Sagittarius. It looks like this:<div class="calibre2"><img alt="155"

    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">A series of more complex figures can be constructed from this figure. Here are some of
        them:<div class="calibre2"><img alt="156" src="images/000139.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Geomantic symbols used in talismans all have the same style and “feel”
        as the ones shown above. They are presented here so you can recognize their appearance when you see them. As an
        example of this, see the book entitled <span class="italic">Raphael’s Ancient Manuscript of Talismanic
          Magic</span>. It contains many typical talismans that use the above geomantic type symbols. It also uses such
        things as the written letters of the Enochian or Angelic language (for samples of this language see the
        Watchtower Ritual).</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There are several other books that have examples that you can use as a
        basis or as a model for your talismans such as <span class="italic">The Black Pullet</span> and the pseudo 6th-
        10th Books of Moses.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">However</span> . . . you will never be a true
        magician if all you can do is copy what others have done before you. It is far better to design your own
        talismans from scratch. This is the way the ancient Kabalists did it, and it is the way you can do it, too.
        Therefore, I strongly urge you to ignore talismans you have seen presented elsewhere and create your own for
        now. Later you can copy or borrow as you will.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In many ways the creation of a talisman is like the designing of a
        magickal ritual. While there are certain rules and patterns to follow, you are allowed a great deal of leeway
        within those patterns.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Remember, anybody can copy anything or follow a few rules. But magick
        is more than just copying and learning rules. That is merely the “science” aspect of magick. What you do within
        the guidelines is the “art” aspect of magick. The best magicians are not mere copyists. They are creative
        artists of the highest caliber. I hope that by the time you finish this course you will be well on your way to
        knowing the rules (being a magickal scientist) and being capable of creativity and originality within those

          <span class="bold1">PART ONE</span>
        </span></span></h1>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">In the previous lesson, as in several other lessons, I have indicated
        that theoretical perfection is not necessary for successful magickal work. All you need to do is your best. This
        is an important consideration, as otherwise there would be even fewer real magicians in the world today.
        Visualization work would be limited to those with textbook-perfect visualization abilities. Vibration of the
        names and sacred words would be limited to those with a full knowledge of Hebrew, Latin, and Greek (not to
        mention Egyptian, Chaldean, Enochian, and other languages) and who are also professional quality singers or at
        least trained in public speaking. Likewise, no talismans would be made, save by artists of the highest
        rank.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Thankfully, this is not necessary. What <span class="italic">is</span>
        necessary is that you do your best&mdash;your very best. But what exactly is your best?</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Imagine for a moment that you are somebody’s supervisor. They turn in
        a piece of work to you for your approval. Although it is very good, you believe that the worker is capable of
        better and you tell the worker so. To this the worker replies, “But this is my best work!” You reply that you
        think the worker is capable of more and want the worker to do the project over. To the pleasure of both of you,
        the new work is far superior.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This is not just some sort of “strive to do better” philosophy. The
        fact is that most of us are not even aware of, or awake to, our capabilities and possibilities.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I have a friend who is a novelist. Years ago, when she was starting
        her career, she asked me to comment on some writing she had done. I told her I would do so only if I could be
        very honest, and she agreed. I read the pages she sent me and called her on the phone to give her my honest
        opinion. I dreaded the conversation because I knew her work could be better, much better. Some of the situations
        were unbelievable. The dialogue was awkward in some places and just inappropriate for the characters elsewhere.
        As I told her what I thought, I could sense her becoming cold and distant. I knew she was furious with me, and I
        thought she would never speak to me again after my critique.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">A few weeks later I got a call from her. She greeted me with, “You’re
        a mean sonofabitch!” She told me that because I was her friend she valued my opinion and how she couldn’t sleep
        for days, upset over what I had said. Finally, she went to a friend who was a writing instructor and asked for
        his opinion. He apparently agreed with me on several points. She spent hours rewriting the pages. She read them
        to me over the phone and I was deeply impressed. She knew that her writing was now much better; I still think it
        is one of the best things she has ever written. I told her, simply, that I knew she was capable of work as fine
        as this and I would not let her get away with doing less than her best.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I don’t know you as I knew her. I knew what she was capable of and I
        expected excellence. Because I don’t know you, even if I were to watch you practice magick I would have no way
        of knowing if the work was the best you could do. I have nothing to compare it to. Therefore, the judgment as to
        the quality of your work cannot be mine or anyone else’s. It must be yours. You should objectively look at what
        you’re doing and determine if it is your best work. Just as we are each responsible for our actions, so, too,
        are we each responsible for doing our best without the prodding of another to excel. This is commonly called
        “self-actualization.” It means that you should not allow yourself to do less than your best. Many times your
        best is better than you think it can be. Strive to always do the very best you can. Understand what is excellent
        for you and accept nothing less than excellence from yourself.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If you ever have the opportunity to talk with people who perform and
        record music for a living, ask them if there is anything they would change on their last album. Having been a
        musician and knowing many musicians, I will tell you now that to a person they will each tell you that there are
        many things they would have done differently. They seek perfection, but settle for their best.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Across my room sits a pentacle that I made. Quite frankly, it not only
        is one of the best things I have ever done, but it is also better than most of the similar pentacles I have
        seen. Some people have told me that it is incredibly well done. But I see the lines that could be better, the
        letters, which could be better formed. It came out better than I thought it ever could, but I am still striving
        for perfection.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Of course, we can never achieve perfection while we are physically
        alive. I have heard that when crafts-people make Persian rugs they will always put in a wrong thread somewhere
        because “only Allah is perfect.” I am not saying that you should make imperfections in your designs for
        talismans. Rather, strive for perfection, but accept your best. Remember, though, that your best may be far
        better than you think.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Let me make clear, then, that the examples of talismans given in this
        course are just that: samples. You can adjust them as you will, adding or subtracting from them according to
        what you think is right. Use them as guidelines only. When you actually construct them for use, when they are no
        longer samples, they need to be your very best.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">With this in mind, let’s look at another sample talisman:</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">After being out of work for six months, “Thomas Jones” has just been
        hired for a new, well-paying job. But over the last several months his debts have piled up. Unless he can get
        help soon, he may be kicked out of where he lives (the gas, electricity, and phone have already been cut off)
        and his car will be repossessed. Thomas decides that he would need a thousand dollars to tide him over until his
        new paychecks start coming in regularly. Notice that in this instance, the desire for money will cover many
        problems. Thus, in this type of situation, doing a talisman for more money is appropriate.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">First, a Tarot divination is done. The results of this divination are
        very positive, so a list is made of what figures and symbols might be included on the talisman.</span></div>

          <div class="calibre16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Perfectionism And Kai Krause</span></span>
          </div>
          <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
          <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Most people have never heard of Kai Krause. In the 1970s and
              1980s he worked on synthesizers, as well as helping on almost thirty movies, receiving an award for his
              work on the first <span class="italic">Star Trek</span> film. He moved to computers and especially user
              interfaces&mdash;the way you interact with software. Many of his original concepts&mdash;now included in
              the Windows, Macintosh, and Linux operating system interfaces&mdash;revolutionized the approach people
              have to software design.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In the computer industry he is perhaps most famous for a series
              of additions or “plug-ins” used in Adobe Photoshop, one of the standard graphics applications, used all
              over the world. This collection, known as “Kai’s Power Tools” or KPT, made it easy for novices to get
              spectacular graphic effects, so much so that some things that were difficult prior to KPT&mdash;such as a
              corner of a page curling up&mdash;became a cliché.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Krause is a true Renaissance man, moving from music to movies to
              computers to graphic interfaces and some spectacular applications, including one of my personal favorites,
              Bryce, which allows you to easily create realistic or surreal 3D scenes. Eventually he sold his products
              and his company to other developers. With the money he purchased a 1,000-year-old castle on the Rhine,
              which he has named “Byteburg.” There, operating under a self-described press embargo, he and a small team
              are designing software that you and I will be using in the future.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The reason I’m bringing him up is because of a statement he made
              that impressed me greatly. He wrote, “A true artist never finishes his work, he merely abandons it.” <a
                id="calibre_link-122" href="#calibre_link-1"><sup class="calibre31">4</sup></a></span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In this lesson I’ve really stressed doing the absolute best that
              you can, adding that often our best is beyond what we think is within our capacity. The problem with
              trying to do our very best is what I call the “curse of perfectionism.”</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Perfectionism is more than just wanting to do the best you can
              possibly do. A perfectionist will work on something over and over and never feel that it is good enough.
              For the perfectionist, the desire to have something absolutely perfect prevents him or her from finishing
              anything. I’ve known some people who have written numerous books but they never even try to get them
              published or even share them with others because “they’re not perfect.” This isn’t because they’re simply
              writing for themselves. They’d like to see their work published, but no matter what they do, it’s never
              good enough.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Back in Lesson 5, I discussed the concept that one of the
              traditional Chinese signs of health was clear thinking and precise action. Going over and over a project
              to try and make it absolutely perfect is the opposite of precise action. In fact, extreme perfectionism
              can be a symptom of what is called Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), something that is not healthy to
              have, and to overcome it may require years of treatment.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">When I write that you should do the best you can, be excellent,
              and your best may be better than you realize, I’m not talking about being a perfectionist. Yes, do the
              best you can when you design something, when you do ritual, in fact, when you do <span
                class="italic">anything</span>. But I would urge you not to be a perfectionist. Even if you think you
              could touch up a little here and do a bit more there, a time comes when, as Krause says, you need to just
              abandon it.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Then make your next project even better!</span></div>

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Now, with all of the information on the previous page, let’s try a
        sample talisman to obtain one thousand dollars. Below you will find the sample design. Side one has the symbol
        from the system of Spare, the number derived from the numerological systems, the number of the Sephira, the name
        of the Sephira, and its translation.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Side two has the sigil from the Rose, the God name, the archangelic
        name, and the translation of that name, plus a heart as the symbol of the heart chakra.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Side three has the symbol for Jupiter in the center. Above is an image

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Thus you can see how easy it is to construct a talisman from the
        information contained so far in this course. I would urge you at this time to try your hand at creating some
        sample talismans. Try one to help pass a test, to win at gambling or obtain spiritual wisdom. Figure out what
        your needs are and then try designing some talismans for those purposes.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">At this point in your studies I suggest that any talismans you create
        should be constructed from the information contained in this course. Do not go to outside sources to help you
        design talismans. This is not meant to hinder you from looking at other sources. I always encourage looking at
        the works of other writers.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I realize that this sounds like a bit of a contradiction, but it is
        not. Let me explain why.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The fact of the matter is some books that claim to be showing
        talismanic symbols give in part or <span class="italic">in</span>
        <span class="italic">toto</span> symbols used to “summon up” spiritual beings, entities, or powers (call them
        what you will). As an example of this I call your attention to the small book <span class="italic">Secrets of
          Magical Seals,</span> by Anna Riva. This book gives a wide variety of symbols with “instructions” on how to
        use them as talismans. One of the largest sections of this book is dedicated to the “Seals of Solomon” and you
        are told “an appropriate seal can be found to influence one’s special situation or objective.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre2"><img alt="165" src="images/000134.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre12"><span class="calibre7">Side Four</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre13">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">These “seals” come directly from <span class="italic">The Greater Key
          of Solomon</span> and are actually known as “Medals or Pentacles.” Their purpose is to strike “terror into the
        Spirits and . . . [reduce] them to obedience . . . If thou invokest the Spirits by virtue of these Pentacles,
        they will obey thee without repugnance, and will fear them, and thou shalt see them so surprised by fear and
        terror, that none of them will be sufficiently bold to wish to oppose thy will.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">These are not figures for use on talismans such as we have been
        discussing. They are protective devices for use in magickal evocations and invocations.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I am not suggesting that you should not look at and study other books.
        I think I’ve made it clear that I encourage you to do so. What I am saying is that, for now, follow the
        instructions in this course. By the end of these lessons you will be able to tell the difference between symbols
        to be used on talismans and symbols to be used for other purposes. At that time freely choose whatever symbols
        you wish on your talismans. At this time, I urge you to stick to what is included in this course. Remember, one
        of the goals of this book is to allow you to pick up and understand any book of magick by the <span
          class="italic">end</span> of these lessons, not by the middle!</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Let’s assume that you have constructed your talisman, after, of
        course, you have done a divination to discover the outcome of making the device. The next step is to empower it,
        to charge it, to consecrate it. This brings us to the next section of this lesson.</span></div>

        </span></span></h1>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">The charging of a Kabalistic talisman requires more preparation and,
        to my mind, involvement than does the charging of a Low Magick talisman. This <span class="italic">may</span>
        make a Kabalistic talisman more powerful. Remember, involving the emotions and passion will enhance the power in
        any ritual. If a ritual is very simple and straightforward, it may not give the practitioner time or direction
        to deeply involve the emotions, to “enflame thyself with prayer.” Note, however, that I used the term “may”
        rather than “will.” All of this depends upon the character of the individual practitioner. If a magician becomes
        deeply involved in a direct and simple ritual, it can be far more powerful than one where a person simply reads
        the words and has no passion. In short, whatever you do, whatever appeals to you, perform it with all your
        heart, spirit, energy, and mind.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In common with the Low Magick talisman, a Kabalistic talisman may be
        constructed at any time. Another similarity is that Talismans should be charged during the waxing of the Moon
        and Amulets should be charged during the waning of the Moon. But the <span class="italic">time</span> for the
        charging of a Kabalistic talisman is far more precisely defined.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The phases of the Moon each last about two weeks. The Kabalah moves
        down to a daily structure. Each day is associated with a planet. Monday is a variation for “Moon-day” and is,
        logically, associated with the Moon. In French, the name of Tuesday is <span class="italic">mardi</span>, the
        day of Mars. Tues was the name of a European god who was equated with the god Mars. Similarly, the northern
        European’s Woden’s day became Wednesday. In French it is <span class="italic">mercredi</span>, the day of
        Mercury. Thor’s day became Thursday. Thor relates to the god Jupiter, and in French <span
          class="italic">jeudi</span> means “Jupiter’s day” and is the name for Thursday. Freya’s day became Friday. In
        French this is <span class="italic">vendredi</span> or “the day of Venus.” Saturn’s day and “Sun-day” are
        obvious.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">From this information we see that each day is associated with a planet:<div
          class="calibre2"><img alt="166" src="images/000112.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>
        <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If we are going to make a talisman associated with the Sephira Hesed
        and the planet Jupiter, it would make sense to charge that talisman on the day associated with that planet,
        Thursday. But there’s more. For the charging of the Kabalistic talisman gets even more precise than moving to a
        day of the week.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Our numerical system is a decimal system known as “base 10.”
        Practically everything numerical is centered on 10. This, however, has not always been the case. At one time
        base 12 was very important and may have been the dominant mathematical system. There are still many remnants of
        base 12. In English there are special names for the first 12 numbers. After that the numbers are combinations
        such as three-ten (thirteen), four-ten (fourteen), twenty-five, thirty-six, etc. There is no “oneteen” or
        “twoteen.” Furthermore, there are 12 inches in a foot, not 10 inches. There are solar 12 months in a year even
        though there are 13 lunar cycles. There are 12 constellations in the zodiacal belt, although more or less could
        have been chosen. As an example, the constellation Cetus, the Whale, is within the zodiacal belt, but is ignored
        by most astrologers.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The day is split into 24 hours. Dividing this in half, we find that
        there are two periods of 12 hours each. It is logical to think that there are 12 daylight hours and 12 darkness
        hours. While this is nice to assume on a theoretical basis, the complicating fact is that this precise 12-and-12
        day only occurs twice during the year: on the equinoxes.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The ancient Kabalists did divide the day into 24 hours and associated
        each hour with a planet. There have been a few variations on the following list, but I have found the one shown
        on the next page, taken from <span class="italic">The Greater Key of Solomon</span>, to be the most
        accurate.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This Table of Magickal or Planetary Hours shows that each hour is
        associated with a planet. If you go back and look at the page of Kabalistic correspondences in Lesson Three, you
        will see that there are no planets associated with either Keter or Hochma. If you make a talisman associated
        with either of these two Sephiroht, it can be charged at any hour. Those talismans associated with the other
        Sephiroht are most effective when charged during the appropriate magickal or Planetary Hour. Charging them at
        other times is fine, but may lessen their effectiveness.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It is important that you understand the comments under the Table of
        Planetary or Magickal Hours. These Magickal Hours are astronomical in nature and are not based upon the ticks or
        inaudible hum of common clocks. Planetary Hours are <span class="italic">not</span> the same as our regular
        sixty-minute hours.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">Here are the steps to find out how long a Planetary Hour is:<div class="calibre24">
          <div class="calibre25">
            <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">1. Divide the number of minutes between sunrise and
                sunset by 12. This gives you the length of a daylight hour.</span></blockquote>

                Magickal Hour from 120 (the number of minutes in two regular or “clock” hours). This gives you the
                number of minutes in a nighttime Magickal Hour that occurs between sunset and sunrise.</span>
            </blockquote>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Example: Let’s say that the sun rises at 5:00 A.M. and sets at 7:00
        P.M. This gives us a daylight period of 14 hours or (multiply by 60 minutes per clock hour) 840 minutes. Divide
        this by 12 and we get a Magickal daylight hour of 70 minutes. This means that the first Magickal Hour will run
        from 5:00 A.M. to 6:10 A.M. The second will run from 6:10 A.M. to 7:20 A.M., etc.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Subtracting 70 (the minutes in a daylight Magickal Hour) from 120 (the
        number of minutes in two clock hours) you will see that a nighttime Magickal Hour on this day lasts 50 minutes.
        Continuing with the above example, we can see that the first evening Magickal Hour will last from 7:00 P.M. to
        7:50 P.M. The second evening Magickal Hour will run from 7:50 P.M. to 8:40 P.M., etc.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Obviously, this entire process could be reversed. You could determine
        the length of time from sunset to sunrise and divide it by twelve to first find the length of a nighttime
        Magickal Hour. It will work both ways. The important thing to remember is that <span class="italic">Planetary or
          Magickal Hours are based on the length of time between sunset and sunrise, sunrise and sunset. They are not
          based on sixty-minute hours.</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">For some reason, many students seem to have difficulty working out the
        Magickal Hours. Usually this lasts until they try to work out a set of Magickal Hours for one day. If,
        therefore, the Planetary Hours are not clear to you right away, try working out a day or two. The sunrise and
        sunset times are listed in most daily newspapers in the weather section. Many sporting goods stores also have
        lists of these times. The can also be found in <span class="italic">Llewellyn’s Daily Planetary
          Guide</span>.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">Magickal or Planetary Hours</span> are not the same
        as regular daily hours. Divide the total time between sunrise and sunset by 12. This will give you the length of
        the Magickal Hours of the day. Dividing the time between sunset and sunrise by 12 will give you the length of
        the Planetary Hours of the night. The hours of the day and night will be of different lengths except on the
        equinoxes.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I am aware of a few computer programs that will automatically work out
        the Planetary Hours for you. These are great timesavers, and if you have computer access and can find such a
        program, I would suggest you to use it. However, knowing how to determine the Magickal Hours is an easy and
        quick skill to develop and master. I would encourage you to do so. Besides, what would you do if the power was
        out or you had no access to computer for your use?</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I advise you to become familiar with the technique but use timesavers

          <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
          <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Codes such as are used in Gematria, Notarikon, and Temura are an
              important part of the Kabalah. I find it curious that modern Kabalists have not yet worked with our modern
              understanding of base systems.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Most commonly, we use base 10. The number just to the left of
              the decimal point is the “one’s place.” You multiply the number that appears there by 1 to determine its
              value. Thus, if you have 7.0, 7 x 1 = 7. The next place is the ten’s place, then the hundred’s place,
              etc.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There is a saying that base 12, as used on clocks, the zodiac,
              etc., is just like base 10 if you had 12 fingers instead of 10. It, too, has a 1’s place, but needs 12
              numerals to fill it up. Let’s use the numerals 0-9 followed by letters “A” and “B.” In base 12 the number
              7.0 equals 7.0 in base 10. But the number “A.0” in base 12 equals 11 in base 10. The next place over is
              not the ten’s place, it’s the twelve’s place. In base 10, 32.0 equals (3 x 10) + (2 x 1). In base 12, 32.0
              equals (3 x 12) + (2 x 1), or 38 in base 10. The next place over in base 12 is the 144’s place (12
              squared). 243.0 in base 12 is (2 x 144) + (4 x 12) + (3 x 1), or 339.0 in base 10.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Computers are focused around base 2. This is because modern
              computers use microprocessors filled with millions of microscopic switches that can be either on or off,
              represented by the numerals 1 or 0. In base 2, as you move to the left of the decimal point there is the
              1’s place, 2’s place, 4’s place, 16’s place, etc. However, when you go beyond our modern “high level”
              programming languages, computers use “machine language,” which is often centered on a base 16 system.
              Since we don’t have 16 numerals, machine language uses a combination of numerals and letters in a code
              know as <span class="italic">hexadecimal</span>. Instead of using the numerals 0 to 9 as we do in base 10,
              hexadecimal uses 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F. Programming languages such as C++
              have converters so you can use the high-level language and allow it to convert to the low-level
              instructions, making programming easier.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I built the first real computer I ever used out of a kit I
              purchased from a company called PAIA. It used an Intel 6802 microprocessor. The computer allowed me to
              program a music synthesizer, also built from a kit, from PAIA. To use it, I used a keypad to arduously
              enter sets of numbers and letters. It was incredibly time consuming.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It seems to me that some enterprising Kabalist will work out a
              coding system using a base system such as this. Maybe you can come up with something? Try it out and use a
              web page to let people know how it works.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">And yes, base 16 is just like base 10 . . . if you have sixteen

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In the last lesson we designed a talisman for friendship that was
        associated with the planet Sol, the Sun. First let me say that I do know that the Sun is not what we would today
        consider a planet. However, the word “planet” means “wanderer.” Those bodies in the skies, which moved faster
        than the slow turn of the stars, were considered to be wanderers or planets. Since the Sun and Moon appear to
        move faster than the backdrop of stars from our Earth-centered point of view, for magickal purposes they are
        considered planets.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The best time to charge this talisman would be on the day associated
        with the planet, Sunday, in the Magickal Hour of the Sun. But let us assume that today is Monday and we do not
        wish to wait for Sunday to come around to charge the talisman. Let us further assume that, because we work all
        day, we wish to charge the talisman in the evening.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">We can see from the previous chart that on Monday the Sun is related to the seventh
        Magickal Hour after sunset. If we also go by the example given earlier of 50-minute magickal evening hours and
        sunset is at 7:00 P.M., we can develop the following chart:<div class="calibre2"><img alt="169"
            src="images/000069.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>
        <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">So on this particular Monday the evening Planetary Hour of the Sun
        does not come until the midnight hour. It may happen that this would not be a good time for us to do the ritual.
        Perhaps we may have to arise early in the morning and do not wish to stay up quite that late.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">On Tuesday evening, however, the Planetary Hour of the Sun comes only
        four Magickal Hours after sunset. Since the times would be very close with only a day difference, this would
        mean that on this particular Tuesday the evening Magickal Hour of the Sun would last from about 9:30 to 10:20
        P.M. with perhaps a few minutes’ difference at most. In this theoretical example, the Tuesday evening hour works
        out fine, so we decide to charge the talisman during the hour of the Sun on Tuesday evening.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Remember, a talisman itself is nothing but inert material. It must be
        activated by the forces of higher planes and guided by our Will. Even if you go to an occult store and buy an
        expensive (and frequently poorly or incorrectly made) talisman, it is still inert until it is charged. The
        effect of the following ritual is to endow an inert and impotent “thing” with balanced motion in a given
        direction.</span></div>

        </span></span></h1>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">One of the famous stories concerning S. L. MacGregor Mathers, a
        founder and driving force behind the Golden Dawn, concerns peas. It seems that he had some enemies within the
        order and he wished to get rid of them. So he took some peas and, according to the story, he “baptized” them
        with the same names as the people of whom he wished to be free. Then he swirled them in a sieve with the idea
        being that as the peas went down the sieve, so, too, would his enemies have a downfall.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Several people I know who claim to be occultists have made fun of
        Mathers over this. They felt that Mathers, the head and guide of the Golden Dawn, should have used ceremonial
        magick techniques and not what seems like Low Magick. It is certainly possible that the exact details of
        Mathers’ actions were incorrectly reported or misinterpreted, because I doubt that Mathers would have let any
        uninitiated person watch him perform the ritual. Isn’t it possible that Mathers or the initiated person
        reporting this episode used expressions such as “peas,” “baptize,” and “sieve” as a “blind” to non-initiates?
        Initiates would be able to figure out that these were code words for other ideas, and non-initiates would have a
        small idea of magickal processes at best, and not be able to understand the codes. I think that this may not
        only be possible, but is likely.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I have talked before about the meaning of initiation, and wish to
        bring it up again. In most initiations the candidate is blindfolded, brought into a new and unfamiliar
        situation, and then taught about his or her new surroundings. This is similar in nature to the birth process.
        First, everything is dark. Then you are thrust into a new situation about which you need to learn. Initiation is
        a type of rebirth. In fact, some occultists claim, much to the consternation of Christian fundamentalists, that
        when the Bible discusses being “born again” what is really being discussed is the idea of initiation. What is
        baptism if it is not an initiation into a particular religion with its accompanying belief system? Did not,
        according to the Bible, Jesus tell his inner group that some things they would understand, but to the masses he
        must speak in parables? (Hmm. That inner group had twelve disciples/initiates. Twelve plus one is the number
        typically associated with small groups such as covens. And that total, thirteen, could just be symbolic of
        unity&mdash;remember that thirteen is the numerological value of the Hebrew word <span
          class="italic">echod</span>, which means “one”&mdash;and is therefore a metaphor for God. Lots of fascinating
        possibilities here.) One function of initiation is that of being born a second time into a new, more spiritual
        way of life. Any valid initiation ritual has this quality. You may wish to look at some books with initiation
        rituals in them to see whether or not this is correct.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I feel that it is possible that in the story about Mathers, “peas”
        were used as a code name for “talismans.” “Baptize” could be a code word for “initiate” and “sieve” a code word
        for the process of focusing mind power. Admittedly, this is just speculation. But if it is correct, what Mathers
        was doing would be <span class="italic">strict</span> Golden Dawn-style ceremonial magick.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">An initiation (or baptism) can give a person a new or second life.
        Does it not follow that something inert, something without a life force, can be given a life force, can be born
        for the first time and given life by the initiation process? The Golden Dawn believed so, and as a result of my
        personal experience, I agree.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">On the next few pages I will be giving a Complete Ritual for Charging
        and Consecrating a talisman. It will be your longest ritual so far and may take up to two hours to perform,
        although one to one-and-a-half is more the norm. So, before starting, I want to show you how it works and
        describe the various sections of the ritual.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The first phase, of course, is the preparations. This means planning
        out the ritual, gathering all necessary tools, designing and constructing the talisman, doing the divination,
        preparing the area and yourself (cleansing), setting up the temple, etc. This should all be finished just before
        the start of the appropriate Magickal Hour.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The second phase of this ritual is the Watchtower Ritual. This should
        take at least fifteen to twenty minutes by itself.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The third phase is not done in the Simple Talisman Charging and
        Consecration Ritual. In this phase you enliven, you actually give a form of life to the talisman, via an
        abbreviated initiation ritual.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Phase four includes charging the talisman by the names and symbols of
        the appropriate cosmic forces or beings.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The fifth phase is the empowering of the talisman, by force of Will,
        charging it to achieve a specific goal.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Finally, phase six concludes the ritual with the Closing by Watchtower
        as described earlier in this course.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Most rituals reach their highest peak of effectiveness when they are
        memorized. You can focus on the ritual rather than reading. Memorizing the LBRP, the Middle Pillar and
        Circulation of the Body of Light, the BRH and Rose Cross Ritual can make them better and more effective. For
        most forms of Grey Magick, memorization is impractical, as there are so many changes. Thus, it is a good idea to
        make up note cards with writing big enough so that you can read the words of the ritual. I use a music stand to
        support 8½ x 11 inch cardstock sheets for the purpose. Thin sheets of paper tend to slip and fall down. You may
        wish to do something similar. Years ago, I used a marker pen so that the words would be bold enough for me to
        read in dim light. Today, I use my computer and printer, making the text large and clear. This also allows me to
        edit the text easily.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If your Magickal Hour is only fifteen or twenty minutes long, how can
        you fit a two-hour ritual into it? The answer is that phases one, two, and three can be done just before the
        start of the Magickal Hour. Parts four and five should occur within the designated Planetary Hour for greatest
        effectiveness. Part six may occur after the end of the Planetary or Magickal Hour.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As you follow through this ritual you will find nothing difficult nor
        unusual, with perhaps one exception. At various times you will see the words “ad-lib.” This is an abbreviation
        for the Latin <span class="italic">ad libitum,</span> the exact translation of which means “at one’s pleasure.”
        However, it is generally taken to mean that you should improvise and do something that is spontaneous and
        without any sort of specific advanced planning. Of course, all of the training and practice you do is a form of
        general advanced planning, and the more ritual you do, the easier such ritualistic adlibbing becomes. The
        important aspect of this is that the specifics of what you do should be both spontaneous and from the heart with
        only the form being practiced. In these sections you are to freely add whatever words or actions you deem
        appropriate for the purpose of that section of the ritual.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If you have been practicing the teachings of this course, such ad-lib
        work is not as hard as you might think. It’s funny&mdash;surveys have shown that the number one fear of most
        people is speaking in public. That means people are more afraid of public speaking than they are of becoming
        crippled, facing a debilitating disease, or dying! The more you practice, however&mdash;and in this case that
        means the more you do the rituals of these lessons&mdash;the easier it becomes. And when it’s easy to do by
        yourself, it becomes easier when in front of a group. Confidence is the key, and confidence comes from knowing
        that you can ad-lib ritual sections easily and effortlessly. The only way you can know this is by doing it,
        first by yourself, and then with others.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">For example, let us assume that there was an invocation followed by the word “ad-lib.” Here
        is an example, just pulled off the top of my head, which would be appropriate:<div class="calibre20">
          <blockquote class="calibre21">

                    permitted me to venture this far into Thy temple of the mysteries. By Thy glory, do not deny your

                  <span class="italic"><span class="bold">Thy</span></span>
                  <span class="bold">name’s sake, not mine. For to Thee is the kingdom and the power and the glory until

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Finally, the most important part of these ad-lib sections is that they

        </span></span></h3>
    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Begin by physically cleansing your working area. If it has a hard
        floor, mop it, or at least vacuum. If you have an air filter that rids the air of dust particles, leave it on in
        your working area for a few hours before cleansing with vacuum and/or water. Wash and polish all of your
        magickal tools, too. If you have some nice music you can play in the background while you do this physical
        preparation it would be nice. Gentle “New Age” music, especially those pieces without strong rhythms or standard
        Western harmonies, are appropriate.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The whole of these preparations should not be thought of in terms of
        “work.” Rather, you should think of these things in the terms of getting dressed up to go out on a Saturday
        night. While doing this physical cleaning, you should direct your thoughts to clearing the area of all unwanted
        or negative influences.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Once this physical cleaning has been completed, set up your working
        area so that it becomes your temple. Place appropriately colored candles around so that you will have enough
        light. However, since you will be leaving the area for a while, if there is even a remote possibility of flame
        or dripping wax starting a fire, don’t light them yet. (It would be wise to have a fire extinguisher handy when
        rituals include flames.) Have all of your tools on the altar and, most importantly, have your already
        constructed talisman and a holder-bag for it on the altar, too. Make sure you have your instructions for the
        ritual close by.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">When you have completed the above work, go to the doorway of the room that contains your
        prepared temple and look the room over. If it is as perfectly prepared as possible, spend a moment
        congratulating yourself on a job well done. Then, take a deep breath, and as you exhale, say:<div
          class="calibre20">
          <blockquote class="calibre21">
            <div class="calibre19">

                    Universe, for Thy permission to construct this temple as a tiny, pale echo of Thy greater creation.
                    May Thy blessings fall upon it for Thy name’s sake. So mote it be!</span></span></div>
            </div>

        <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Then close the door so that nobody else can enter the room. Lock the
        door if necessary. Note that besides asking for the grace of Divinity upon the temple, we are also calling the
        temple a small version of the entirety of the Universe; the microcosm to the macrocosm of the cosmos. As above,
        so below. In this way the altar becomes the exact center of the universe, the meeting place of balance and
        harmony for all elemental and planetary forces, all spiritual and physical powers.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The next step is to turn off the telephone or cell phone so that its
        ring will not disturb you. If you live with other people and cannot do this, tell them you do not wish to be
        disturbed for the next few hours, and should the phone ring and be for you, ask them to please take a
        message.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">Finally, take a ritual cleansing bath as already described. When finished, put on your
        ritual robe or special clothes reserved for ritual work. If you have any special magickal jewelry, now is the
        time to put it on, too. As you put on your garments and jewelry, say:<div class="calibre20">
          <blockquote class="calibre21">
            <div class="calibre19">
              <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">Blessed art Thou, O Lord, Maker of the
                    Universe, who usest Thy universe as but a foot-stool: for Thou hast allowed me to don the robes of
                    the magickal art</span> [or say something similar ad-lib]<span class="bold">.</span></span></div>

        <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Upon completion of your ritual bath and donning of the robe, it should
        be the time to enter your temple. By this I mean it should be the start of the appropriate magickal Planetary
        Hour, or early enough so that the important body of the ritual will take place during that time frame. If it is
        too early, it is okay to enter the temple but you should not begin the ritual. Rather, you should sit in quiet
        contemplation until the correct beginning time. Think about what you are going to do in a few minutes. Consider
        the months and hours you have put in practicing the rituals, doing the spiritual exercises, and earning yourself
        the right to do the ritual you will be performing shortly. And, of course, also think about the awe and majesty
        of the Divine Source of all.</span></div>

          <div class="calibre16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Another Approach to Prepatory Work: The <span
                  class="italic">Mitzvah</span></span></span></div>
          <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
          <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Work. Generally, people think of work as, well, <span
                class="italic">work</span>. It’s something you gotta do. It’s appropriate that “work” is a four-letter
              word as are some other powerful swear words. If you’re a creative person, having to work to pay rent,
              taxes, bills, etc., takes you away from your creative endeavors. Work, well, sometimes work just sucks.
              Big time.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">So when you think of the preparatory work you do with your
              ritual space and tools, you may sigh and grudgingly do it. In the body of these lessons I suggested that
              you consider it work in the sense of the work you do on yourself to get ready to go out on a Saturday
              night. You know&mdash;any shaving you might do, taking a shower, picking the right clothes, getting
              dressed, changing clothes when you don’t like the way the ones you picked look on you, driving to where
              you’re going, etc. That’s real work.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Of course, maybe you don’t think of it in that way. Maybe this
              metaphor doesn’t work for you at all. After all, vacuuming a room is <span class="italic">not</span> the
              same as blow-drying your hair.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Let me present another approach. It’s based on the Hebrew word
              <span class="italic">mitzvah</span>.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Mitzvah is a curious word in that it has two contrasting
              meanings that are both valid. First, it means “a commandment.” In the Bible, it’s something you are
              commanded to do by God. Normally, when we think of something we have to do we think of it as work. If your
              parents tell you to do your homework, or if your boss tells you to finish a report, those are more than
              just requests, they’re commandments. You have to do them, and doing them entails work.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">However, mitzvah has a second meaning: a blessing. Specifically,
              it is a blessing&mdash;and you receive blessings from God&mdash;when you do the work. So yes, some task
              may be work, but you’ll be blessed and honored for doing it.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Perhaps this is the metaphor that will work best for you.
              Instead of thinking of the preparatory tasks before a ritual as work, think of them as a blessing. The
              blessing you’ll receive is greater ritual success.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Remember, magick takes place all the time, 24/7. Although the
              ritual per se supercharges and focuses the magick, what you do before and after is also important. If your
              cleaning is second-rate and perfunctory, your actions will be countering the effects of the ritual. So if
              you want the blessing of a highly successful ritual, approach the pre-ritual work as if it a mitzvah. Yes,
              it’s something you have to do, but it’s also a blessing leading to greater magickal success when you do
              it.</span></div>

              This theater of the bizarre displayed such things as the supposed bones of Vlad Tepes the Impaler, who was
              fictionalized as Dracula; the supposed head of “Landru,” known as Blackbeard, who murdered his wives; and
              a boy with two heads. The latter was a malformed fetus that had spontaneously aborted and was now in a
              bottle of formaldehyde. Years ago, sideshows at carnivals frequently used fetuses in formaldehyde with
              overstated claims about the exhibit in order to bring in the “rubes.” Between themselves, the carneys who
              operated the exhibits referred to them as “pickled punks.”</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The group also used the upstairs rooms for doing rituals. In
              July 1984, someone left some candles burning after a ritual. The result was a fire that caused a lot of
              destruction. Investigators found the exhibits and demanded explanations for human bones, fetuses, and the
              like. Naturally, the result ended up in the newspaper, along with all sorts of bizarre and incorrect
              guesses and rumors as to the uses for these odd items. The fact that they were sideshow exhibits was
              ignored.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The shop eventually moved and changed its name, becoming Pan
              Pipes. In 1995 the shop was purchased by actress and star of such movies as <span class="italic">The
                Craft</span>, Fairuza Balk (who, it turned out, lived just two blocks from my apartment in Venice
              Beach). She sold it and is no longer associated with the shop.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Today, the shop is called Panpipes Magickal Marketplace, and
              since the original shop opened in 1961, they claim they are the oldest occult shop in the U.S.A. Although
              the physical size of its “bricks and mortar” store is rather small (they do a large online business), it
              has been used as a set in numerous films and TV shows.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The point of this story is that if people who are experts with
              candles can still make errors resulting in serious fires, so can you. When fire is involved, be extra
              careful. To repeat what I wrote: “It would be wise to have a fire extinguisher handy when rituals include
              flames.”</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Finally, everything will be ready. You will have already done a
              divination. The temple is prepared. The talisman is prepared. The phase of the Moon is correct. The ritual
              you will do is written down so you will not err. And most importantly, you are ready to begin.</span>

          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In the next lesson I will explain how to work with the “grimoires.”
        These are some of the most famous of magickal texts. Unfortunately, many of them are either incomplete, such as
        <span class="italic">The Arbatel of Magic</span>, are questionable, such as the <span
          class="italic">Necronomicon</span>, are too time consuming, such as <span class="italic">Abramelin</span>, or
        are too rare and expensive.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Therefore, I will be basing the lesson on two texts that are
        reasonably priced and available at many occult bookstores. The books are <span class="italic">The Greater Key of
          Solomon</span> and <span class="italic">The Goetia</span>, which is a section of <span class="italic">The
          Lesser Key of Solomon</span>. Both are available in more than one edition, and any edition will work. If you
        wish to be a ceremonial magician, I strongly urge you to obtain these two books.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">I have talked often about how most self-professed “magicians” talk a great deal but do
        nothing. I know many people who have the Lesser and Greater Keys and have looked through them, but have never
        practiced the rituals or techniques that are within them. There are many reasons for this, but the three primary
        reasons are based on fear and egotism:<div class="calibre24">
          <div class="calibre25">
            <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">1. They don’t have enough knowledge to do them. They
                are afraid that if they seek out that knowledge they will learn just how little they know and expose
                themselves for not being the “great occultists” they claim to be.</span></blockquote>
          </div>
          <div class="calibre25">
            <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">2. They fear the rituals and don’t even wish to try
                them. Even worse, they are afraid of what might happen if they <span class="italic">are</span>
                successful and cannot control the powers they summon.</span></blockquote>
          </div>
          <div class="calibre25">
            <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">3. They’re afraid that if they try them and fail it
                will show that they are not as good as they claim to be. Or, it will prove to them that magick is fake
                and they have wasted years of their lives in its study.</span></blockquote>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Again, if you do not own these books, I urge you to obtain them. It
        would be better for you to spend a few weeks obtaining them while you study this and the previous lessons rather
        than going ahead. Versions may even be available online, but you should print them out.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Everything you will need to try out some of the rituals will be
        printed in the next lesson, but these books give advanced information along the lines of the Kabalistic
        correspondence charts. They give lists of powers or entities who are appropriate to deal with when seeking to
        obtain certain items or qualities.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If you have these books, or if you obtain them soon, do not try any of
        the rituals before going through the next lesson. You can’t get hurt like so many seem to fear, but you may be
        wasting your time. The next lesson will include the information you need which makes the grimoires workable.
        Furthermore, these books deal with magickal evocation and the bringing to visible appearance entities from
        higher levels of reality.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Back in the beginning of this course I told you that you would not be
        “summoning” anything up. How, then, can something be evoked to visible appearance without summoning it
        up?</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I promise you that you will learn all this and more. You will learn
        the true secrets of magickal evocation. And you will see that the rituals in the grimoires are the first ones in
        these lessons which are easier to do in groups and more difficult (but not impossible) to do by
        yourself&mdash;virtually pure ceremonial magick!</span></div>

        <span class="bold1">The Secrets of the Magickal Evocation of Spirits</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Magick works!</span> We can assume that this is
        true until a time when experience allows us to say not that we assume magick works, not that we believe magick
        works, but that we <span class="italic">know</span> magick works. If this is not true, then you are wasting your
        time reading this course and I’ve wasted my time writing it.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Obviously, I do not think that this is so. For, as a result of over
        twenty years of experience, I know that magick works.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">To briefly repeat some information from an earlier lesson, the
        magickal tradition holds that the Source of All created laws under which we all must live. One such law is
        gravity. We cannot jump high enough to escape gravity’s grip. However, once we understand gravity we can build
        rockets with enough thrust to lift us beyond gravity’s hold.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There are many laws that were unknown only a hundred years ago. This
        includes the laws concerning the weak and strong atomic forces, laws that are a basis of modern physics.
        Similarly, there are other laws that are still not commonly known. Among these are the laws of magick.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Either these laws are valid and true or they are not true natural
        laws. Either there is gravity or there is not gravity. There is no in between. Likewise, either the laws of
        magick are valid or they are not. There cannot be any type of rule saying that sometimes they are valid and
        other times, under identical conditions, they are invalid. Remember, magick is an art and <span
          class="italic">science</span>, and a basic tenet of science is that under the same conditions an experiment
        will always have the same result.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Now put this idea on the “back burner” for a moment while I discuss
        art&mdash;not the art of magick, mind you, but the art of motion pictures, fictional novels, and short stories.
        You’ve read them or seen the films. The wizard casts a spell and out of the mists appears a demon to do the
        wizard’s dirty work. One of the best examples of such a film is a 1957 black-and-white movie called <span
          class="italic">Night of the Demon</span> (also known as <span class="italic">Curse of the Demon</span>)
        starring Dana Andrews and directed by Jacques Tourneur. (The evil magician, Dr. Julian Karswell, played by actor
        Niall MacGinnis, was supposedly modeled after Aleister Crowley.) Also look at <span class="italic">Doctor
          Faustus</span> with Burton and Taylor. Read some of the stories by H. P. Lovecraft, who makes Poe sound like
        Erma Bombeck. Look also at the Dr. Strange comic book.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I’m sure you can think of many more films and stories that have a hero
        or villain summoning up creatures from some astral netherworld. And, in all honesty, wouldn’t you like to do
        that? Wouldn’t you like to have the power to summon up some ghastly beastie to control people, help your
        friends, and punish those who have hurt you?</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In all honesty, the <span class="italic">possibility</span> of doing
        that is one of the reasons my interest in magick was maintained over my first few years of study. I didn’t want
        to actually do such things, but I wanted to know if such things were possible. At least, that’s what I convinced
        myself. If only I could find the right book or teacher, I could have the powers of the universe in my grasp!
        Needless to say, had such a thing happened to me my karma would be in an awful state! Further, my mystical
        leanings have led me far away from the desire to control others. But still, wouldn’t it be nice to evoke a being
        to our plane of existence who will take revenge on bad people?</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The movies and books and stories I had read greatly influenced me.
        Taking that influence and combining it with my understanding that magick works initially led me to totally
        ignore a very useful grimoire, that part of <span class="italic">The Lesser Key of Solomon</span> published as
        the <span class="italic">Goetia</span>.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In the <span class="italic">Goetia</span>&mdash;at the end of the
        first conjuration to “call forth” any of the spirits listed in the book&mdash;it advises, “if the Spirit come
        not yet, say as followeth.” Then the book gives another summoning or evoking conjuration, at the end of which it
        says, “If He come not yet at the rehearsal of these two first conjurations (but without doubt he will), say on
        as followeth.” This is followed by commands rather than requests for appearance, commands that are filled with
        and followed by a series of rather nasty curses.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">To me, this just did not make sense. If all entities in the universe
        follow certain cosmic laws, they must appear when they are called. Otherwise, magick would not be a science and
        there could be no such thing as a magickal system. Obviously, something must be missing.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In my studies of this and other ancient grimoires, I learned that
        virtually none of the grimoires, the ancient texts on magick, were complete. I decided to think about this from
        a more historical point of view.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As recently as a century ago, students of magick didn’t just pick up a
        book and start practicing. Rather, they would train under the guidance of a teacher or mentor, someone who
        learned magick in this same teacher/student method. So if a student was not expected to learn magick from a
        book, what exactly were these “grammar books” of magick? It became clear to me that these books were meant to be
        guidelines and tips for the students. They were meant to give in written form those items that could not be
        quickly memorized nor repeated so frequently that rote memorization would occur. That means <span
          class="italic">the real secrets of magick consist of what was <span class="bold">not</span> included in the
          ancient texts!</span> Whatever those things are, combined with what is in the grimoires, form the real
        workings of practical magick. So what is it that every student of magick needs to know in order to work with the
        grimoires?</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">After years of study, practice, and analysis, I came to the conclusion that there were just
        three primary things a student of magick had to memorize, internalize, and be able to do. These three things
        are: <div class="calibre24">
          <div class="calibre25">
            <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">1. <span class="bold">The development of a positive
                  attitude about success with magick</span>
              </span></blockquote>
          </div>
          <div class="calibre25">
            <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">2. <span class="bold">The ability to generate or raise
                  magickal energy</span>
              </span></blockquote>
          </div>
          <div class="calibre25">
            <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">3. <span class="bold">The ability to manipulate and
                  direct the raised energy</span>
              </span></blockquote>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Let’s examine each of these concepts. The idea of a positive attitude
        about magick is that you must know (not hope or wish) that the magick you are doing is going to work. This does
        not mean that magick is nothing more than a mental practice. If you are ailing, a doctor can give you medicines,
        but unless you really wish to get better, there will be a much longer healing period and, in fact, you might not
        heal at all. This is a mental “will to live” which can affect you on the physical plane. The mind has effects on
        all planes. Likewise, the knowledge that your magick will succeed will alter all planes. Simply knowing your
        magick will work doesn’t cause the magick to work&mdash;it merely allows it to do so. But if you think magick
        won’t work, it won’t! Part of being a ceremonial magician is having the right mental attitude.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The second part of the needed skills a magician must learn is the
        ability to generate magickal energy. This you have been doing when you practice the Middle Pillar Ritual. The
        third part of magick to learn is the ability to manipulate and direct the energy you have generated. This you
        have been practicing with the Circulation of the Body of Light and the LBRP. In fact, your work with all of the
        rituals has helped you develop the abilities to generate, manipulate, and direct energy.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The development of these three skills has always been a major focus of
        magickal training, and a student would have practiced for hours and would learn where in a ritual the energy
        should be raised and how it should be directed. With all this training, there was no need to include these
        concepts in any book on magick. The student was supposed to know these things. That is why all ancient grimoires
        are purposefully incomplete.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Earlier in these lessons I pointed out how a simple sentence was the
        key to Grey Magick. However, when I first wrote it earlier in these lessons you may have glossed over it because
        I didn’t specifically draw your attention to it. In a similar way, it took me several years to realize something
        to which I had never paid attention. There is a translation of the <span class="italic">Sepher Yetzirah</span>
        by Phineas Mordell (<span class="italic">Origin of Letters and Numerals According to the Sefer Yetzirah</span>,
        Weiser, 1979, now out of print) which states that the Yud Heh Vahv Heh of the Tetragrammaton may be a code for
        duplicated or other letters. Also, a friend pointed out to me that Witches (she is a Wiccan) frequently used
        codes in their Book of Shadows, books that contain their rituals and instructions. As an example, “baby’s blood”
        was a code for strawberry juice. Thus, if a Witch’s Book of Shadows fell into the hands of an uninitiated person
        that person might be too scared or too offended to try out any information in the book. Unfortunately, the books
        sometimes fell into the possession of people who actually believed a literal interpretation of what they read. A
        history of torture and death is one of the results of this. In retrospect, I would say the decision to use some
        of those codes might not have been the wisest choice.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I don’t remember the exact day, but I suddenly had a flash of
        intuition and realized that the grimoires had codes so that idiots (like myself some years ago) wouldn’t get
        into trouble doing things for which we were not prepared. I realized that the secrets of magickal evocation were
        not in the grimoires, or if they were, they were in code. I had to solve this mystery!</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I had so many questions. Why did grimoires call for more than one
        person to do an evocation? Why is there a circle drawn inside the triangle where the entity manifests? How do
        the pentacles for magickal evocation work? Why does incense of a particular scent draw entities from other
        levels of existence to the physical plane? If it is because they like the astral form of the incense as some
        claim, they could stay on the astral plane and enjoy it without having to materialize. There were too many
        questions and no answers.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Then one day a friend who is a very knowledgeable occultist made a
        passing remark about the foolishness of those who thought that magickal evocation rarely happened. He said that
        some magicians wrongly believed that entities were only drawn to the local area of the astral plane so that they
        could be more easily dealt with. Naturally, he had never done any evocations of any sort himself.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I laughed with him about this. How absurd! I, who up to that time had
        never done an evocation, knew that such a concept was ridiculous.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">I continued working on my own magickal and spiritual development, only dealing with the
        concept of evocation when it came up in books and in conversations with people who were actually performing
        evocations. I discovered that three Crowley-oriented groups I was aware of believed and practiced magickal
        evocations only to the astral plane. I found a self-published book, <span class="italic">Secret Magick
          Revealed,</span> by two excellent occultists, Nelson and Anne White, who agree with this idea (the book has
        gone out-of-print following his death in 2003). Finally, really making my understanding sure, I read in <span
          class="italic">Aspects of Occultism</span> by Dion Fortune:<div class="calibre20">
          <blockquote class="calibre21">
            <div class="calibre19">
              <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">In the great majority of cases of
                    evocative magick, the form is built up on the astral and can only actually be seen by the
                    clairvoyant, though any sensitive person can feel its influence.</span></span></div>
              <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">The initiated magician is usually,
                    unless engaged in some special experiment or research, content to evoke to visible appearance on the
                    astral, depending upon his psychic powers for communication with the entity evoked. He does not go
                    to the trouble to evoke to visible appearance on the physical because, if he is an adequate psychic,
                    astral appearance serves his purpose just as well; in fact better, because it is more congenial to
                    the nature of the beings . . . and places less limitation upon their activities.</span></span></div>
            </div>
          </blockquote>
        </div>
        <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Certain substances can be used to induce physical manifestation.
        Fortune adds that of these substances, “the principal [one] is fresh blood; excreta can be used for the same
        purpose.” However, their ability to give off “ectoplasm” from which these entities can create a physical
        appearance wears “off by the time the body heat has departed.” This corresponds with the Tantric belief that
        semen loses its magickal potency with fifteen minutes after ejaculation.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">Since this course is an introduction to ceremonial magick we will not be going into the
        study of evoking entities to the physical plane, and there will be no instructions for blood
        sacrifices&mdash;usually a few drops of one’s own blood&mdash;on these pages. But will the idea of evocation
        only to the astral plane answer the questions we have? Let’s go through some of them and see:<div

                physical appearance&mdash;you can see them. Certainly this can and does include seeing them on the

                humans are not so easily controlled. The seer may need large doses of incense, many minutes of
                contemplating the pentacles, and frequent repetition of the evocations to open his or her psychic vision
                to that level of the astral plane where they can see and communicate with an entity that has come to do

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The fact of the matter is that if we assume magickal evocation brings
        entities to communication with us on the astral plane rather than on the physical plane, it virtually solves all
        of our questions. It will also answer the question you may have had as to how I could teach you how to evoke
        entities (to visible appearance) without summoning up anything (onto the physical plane).</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I have spent several pages sharing how I learned this magickal secret
        and how it answered all of my questions. When you first started taking this course, you may have thought if you
        said a few words or waved a magick wand something you desired would instantly occur. By now you should know
        (hopefully by experience) that magick takes time and occurs through totally natural means. Similarly, it is time
        to disabuse yourself of the false notion that if everything is done correctly, demons will rise out of the haze
        to do in your enemies. It is time to learn to ignore the fantasies of those who write or make films of occult
        fiction but have never practiced even one magickal ritual. In all likelihood they do not even believe in the
        possibility that magick works.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">As you have noted, I have consistently used the term “evocation” in
        the discussion of the type of magick being presented in this lesson. In your readings you may have noticed that
        there are some authors who use “invocation” as a synonym of evocation. This error is never made by real
        magicians, and is only presented by writers who either have no practical magickal experience or by those who
        wish to blur the distinctions of different types of magickal practices. This blurring is usually done in an
        attempt to make all forms of magickal work seem the same in order to cast negative aspersions on all
        magick.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If you have been doing the work of this course you will find evocative
        magick very safe. Its purpose is to allow you to communicate with other intelligences, powers, or entities that
        do not exist on our physical plane. Some people contend that we are only communicating with aspects of our
        unconscious minds that are normally hidden. Whether or not this is so I do not know or care. This is because
        evocative magick functions as if one is dealing with other entities and no matter the source, is treated as if
        one is dealing with external intelligences.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I have seen many serious problems develop after the use of invocatory
        magick by those who are not competent in magick. Invocation is the magickal act wherein you allow your body to
        be temporarily shared by another entity. The modern name of this process is “channeling.” As long as your
        banishings are properly done and the magician chooses whom to allow to join in the use of his or her body, there
        is no danger. It is when there is little thought or control in the magickal act that problems occur.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I have been to many Wiccan rituals where the aspects of Divinity,
        generically called the God and the Goddess, have been successfully and safely invoked. </span></div>

          <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">One of the challenges with magick comes with the development and
              attempted perfection and control of the ego. Unfortunately, no matter how much people work on this (or
              profess to work on this) it is not always achieved. And let’s face it&mdash;if you’re running a magickal
              order (or even if you just think you know enough to write a book on magick) you’re going to have some
              level of ego . . . and egotism.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It is this egotism that has resulted in the “I’m right, you’re
              wrong, no alternatives” attitude that has resulted in what can only be called “magickal wars.” There have
              been magickal wars between groups that called themselves the “real” Rosicrucians, both of whom called the
              other “black sex magicians.” Crowley and Mathers warred with each other. Witchcraft groups have warred
              with each other. And the silly warring&mdash;taking people away from doing the
              work&mdash;continues.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I had been the member of a magickal order that a woman and her
              followers tried to take over. I stood with the founders, creating more than a little anger on her part
              against me. When <span class="italic">Modern Magick</span> was first published, she had one of her
              surrogates attack it for such things as using a different form of Hebrew transliteration. I had stated
              twice that I was using modern Hebrew and why I had made that choice. In fact, I simply answered the false
              claims about the book so stridently that she said nothing for some time. After <span class="italic">Modern
                Magick</span> became popular she started to claim that she had been my teacher (I had taken one class
              from her, which consisted of each student doing a book report&mdash;there was almost no input from
              her).</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">More interesting&mdash;and the reason I bring it up
              here&mdash;was an attack on this lesson in previous editions of <span class="italic">Modern Magick</span>
              by another person. He claimed I gave no sources although I listed in this lesson all of the sources I had
              for this section. He claimed I “stole” it from him even though I had never read anything by him on the
              subject (I don’t know if he wrote anything). He kept saying that he talked about it on a TV show that was
              on at 1:00 A.M. Sorry, but in those days I was either out playing music or already asleep.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">He didn’t talk about how he cheated me out of a small sum of
              money and wouldn’t respond when I wrote to him about it. He didn’t talk about how his lawyer threatened to
              sue me. He did, in a message, claim that he thought I was working with one of his enemies. He did,
              repeatedly, demand that I change my book to list him as a source. I told him that I listed all of my
              sources, and if he had influenced those sources, he should have them change their books. He spent a lot of
              time&mdash;and I mean <span class="italic">a lot of time!</span>&mdash;blasting me in various areas of the
              Internet such as the newsgroups on Usenet.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Such wars are nothing but a colossal waste
                of time, energy, and effort!</span> When you see magickal wars starting or continuing&mdash;and if you
              continue studying and practicing magick you eventually will&mdash;I would encourage you to ignore them and
              just do your work. To my attackers: good luck on your future magickal work. I honestly wish you well and

    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">It is quite a remarkable transformation as the facial characteristics
        of the people into whom the God and Goddess are invoked (usually the High Priest and High Priestess) and even
        the body’s carriage sometimes seems to alter and give a far more regal appearance than the normal, daily
        appearance of these people. Done properly, this magickal procedure is quite safe and quite thrilling. It should
        always be done with positive entities (or, if you prefer, positive aspects of our unconscious) and never with
        unknown or “negative” entities, i.e., those who might give suggestions, which, if followed, would increase our
        burden of negative karma.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There are two instances when invocation or channeling can be dangerous
        or at least very anti-productive. The first is when you perform no banishings and invite absolutely any entity
        to share your body. Certainly from your readings and practice and thoughts about magick you can see just how
        dangerous this could be. Yet, a whole religion has developed based on this magickal act. This religion is known
        as Spiritualism or Spiritism. Most practicing occultists tend to frown on the practices of Spiritism because it
        allows virtually any entity to communicate with the living. Just because something (usually a very low-astral
        entity, more on this in a later lesson) says it is Uncle Charlie doesn’t mean it’s so. There have been instances
        of damage in séances caused by these low elementals and some mediums have ended their lives as
        alcoholics.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Furthermore, just because Uncle Charlie died doesn’t mean he got any
        smarter! Yet many, many people change their lives because of messages given by entities claiming to be deceased
        relatives or friends. Please understand that I am not condemning the religion of Spiritism nor its philosophy.
        Certainly everyone is entitled to his or her own religious beliefs. Nor am I condemning invocatory magick such
        as that from which séances borrow. What I am condemning is lack of preparation, lack of protection, and blind
        acceptance of frequently wrong or valueless information. If you think that this is unjust, look at the hundreds
        of books published by channeled writers (not all of whom are Spiritists, but who have taken their techniques
        from Spiritists) who claim to have the real writings of people such as Einstein, Tesla, Nurmi, and Edison. In
        thousands of pages and millions of words, not one thing has ever been presented that has revolutionized life or
        could not be learned from previous information.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">And I have not mentioned the self-deception and outright fraud which
        has been a part of modern Spiritism since its inception in the middle of the nineteenth century.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The second instance of danger occurring in this type of magick is if a
        “negative” entity is invoked. One of the most fascinating stories concerning Aleister Crowley is how he allowed
        the “demon Choronzon” to be invoked into his body. Once invoked, the “demon” tried to attack Crowley’s assistant
        using numerous ploys. Some people believe that Crowley’s successes began to diminish after this, perhaps because
        Choronzon was never properly banished.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Invocation is a very important part of magick, but for safety it must
        be done correctly. This will be covered in another lesson.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">After this discussion on the difference between evocation and
        invocation, we turn our attention back to the former and see how it is done. This will show us how to use two of

            sells glass and have them cut a flat disc of it for you. The diameter of this disc will depend upon the size
            of your triangle. It should not cover any of the lettering, although it can be smaller than the diagram
            indicates. About four inches is the smallest that is easy to use. On the big end, one and one-half to two
            feet in diameter is about maximum.<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span

                are rather sharp and could seriously cut you. Until it is mounted I urge that you wear protective gloves
                when handling it. This is true even if you can find a store that has precut circular pieces of glass
                with fused edges which are not sharp.</span></div>
            <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">When you have your glass disc, place it under running water
                and purify it as was done with talismans. If it is small enough this can be done in a sink. Larger
                pieces will need the use of a stream, bathtub, or shower. <span class="italic">Be very careful!</span>
                Next, dry the piece of glass thoroughly with a clean, soft cloth. Place the glass down on several sheets
                of newspaper or a drop cloth. Make sure that the topmost side is totally dry and free of lint and water
                spots. Spray-paint this side with <span class="italic">flat</span> black paint. In my experience the
                best paint to use for this is paint designed for making blackboards, however any flat black paint that
                will adhere to glass will do. Apply several light coats according to the instructions on the paint. On
                the last magick mirror I made, I used thirteen coats of paint. Excess paint will not hurt it, but too
                little paint will. Allow plenty of time for the paint to dry. Then, turn your mirror over and see if
                there is any paint on the other side. If so, remove it with paint remover, a paint scraper, or a razor
                blade. Again, be careful not to cut yourself or scratch the surface of the glass. Wearing soft gloves,
                now hold the glass up to a bright light source and see if any light at all can pass through the magick

            are “L” shaped pieces of metal or plastic with a screw or nail going through one of the bars of the “L.”
            Once screwed into the wood it can be pivoted so that the other bar of the “L” is toward the center of the
            glass. This holds the mirror in place. If the mounts are turned away from the center the mirror may be
            removed.</span></blockquote>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">You will need to use at least three of these mirror mounts with one
        toward each corner of the “Triangle of the Art.” However, the bigger the glass, the more mounts you should use
        for safety. Once mounted, paint the mounts flat black using a small brush. If you cannot find these mounts,
        nails driven into the wood at various points along the circumference of the mirror will do. Of course, the nails
        should be painted flat black also.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It is important to make very clear that the side of the glass that is
        painted black should be against the wood of the triangle. In other words, if you are looking at the triangle
        with the mirror mounted, the unpainted side of the glass should be toward you and the painted side should be the
        far side of the glass, next to the wood. This will have the effect of making the black paint, seen through the
        glass, appear quite shiny. Once mounted, your construction of the magick mirror within the “Triangle of the Art”
        is complete.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Now look again at the diagram from the <span
          class="italic">Goetia</span> . It appears that a complete circle is drawn on the ground. It also appears that
        outside of the circle the triangle is drawn on the ground.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I am sure that this will upset many “grimoire purists,” but the fact
        of the matter is that there is no need to draw a physical circle. Should you draw one if it gives you more
        confidence or makes you feel more secure? Sure, go right ahead. But if you are good with your banishings, as the
        many months of practice while taking this course should have made you, it is enough. My personal experience and
        the experience of others proves this to be true. Why, then, are there complex instructions and figures in the
        diagram? Of course, the writer or copyist of the diagram is not here so there is no way to be sure, but it
        appears to be merely a cover, a blind to deceive any person into whose hands the document might wrongly fall.
        And considering the small number of people who have ever attempted the magick of this book against the large
        number of people who own it, this blind has been very successful.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">To repeat, if you wish to draw the complete circle on the ground, go
        ahead. Those who do this usually use chalk. Some have painted it on a hardwood floor and, when not being used,
        cover it with a carpet. Others have painted it on a large cloth which can be laid out when needed, but rolled up
        and put away at other times. I’ve even seen some people who make a circle out of wood with several sections, and
        lay those sections on the floor when it is time to do the ritual. But if you have been following this course,
        doing one lesson a month, and have been doing the daily rituals, it is not necessary.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Another consideration is that using the Triangle of the Art with its
        magick mirror while having it flat on the floor outside of your circle is absurdly difficult. However, placing
        it in this position assumes that the original artist was an expert at three-dimensional representation. If you
        look at the copy of the original page, it clearly shows that the artist had trouble with proportions and lines.
        Is it not possible that the Triangle was not meant to be flat on the floor?</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Early drawings of Christian figures frequently show a disc behind the
        head of the religious figure. It is believed that this is meant to represent a halo. Since the artist did not
        have the skills to show it surrounding the head, it is shown behind the head.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In a similar manner, the artist who made this sketch may have wished
        to show the correct shape and lettering of the Triangle. However, he or she did not have the necessary artistic
        knowledge or skill to show it in its proper position.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The Triangle of the Art should be placed outside the area of where the
        circle will be formed. The Triangle should be raised up so that the center of the mirror is at the eye level of
        the seer (more on the seer, later). Obviously, if there is a chair for the seer the Triangle will be at a
        different height than if the seer stands. Although the Triangle may hang straight up and down (vertical), more
        commonly the top is made to lean back so that it is at an angle. To achieve this tilt, the Triangle may be
        rested upon a chair, an artist’s easel, or a music stand. Make sure that the Triangle is firmly supported and
        will not fall over. The Triangle should be placed east of where the circle will be formed, but quite close to
        the edge of where your circle will be. With this, and your regular preparations, most of your physical

          <span class="bold1">PART THREE</span>
        </span></span></h1>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">As I have shown, most forms of magick can be done by yourself. Indeed,
        traditionally most Grey Magick group workings have the group merely observing and adding their visualizations to
        that of the operator, the magician actually doing the work.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">But with the magick of evocation, everything changes. Although it is
        <span class="italic">possible</span> to do evocations solo, it is much more difficult. Many people trying this
        type of solo work achieve little if any success. Therefore, I suggest that you have another person, a <span
          class="italic">seer</span>, help you with the evocation. Or, if you are going to act as the seer, you will
        need another person to perform important parts of the ritual.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It is the seer’s task to look into the magick mirror and see the being
        evoked. The seer then functions as an intermediary between the ritualist and the evoked entity. The ritualist or
        operator recites the callings and evocations that not only call the desired entity to the mirror, but also aid
        the seer in obtaining the vision necessary to see something in the mirror.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If you are working with a group of people, your first trial at
        evocative magick should involve as the seer the person who has the most psychic sensitivity. Clues to this are
        ease at doing divinations, divinations that go far beyond the inherent limitations of the system used (i.e.,
        extreme precision), divinations that prove correct on a very regular basis, a very detailed dream memory, a very
        strongly emotional or overemotional person, a daydreamer, etc.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Because of societal influences, the fact is that the best seers are
        frequently women. If you have a person such as has been described in your group, be that person male or female,
        use that person as your seer in your first experiment. If not, try a volunteer. If you follow the directions
        given here, the worst thing that could happen is that your seer will see, hear, or sense nothing. This would not
        necessarily be due to failure of your experiment, but rather because the seer may not have an adequately opened
        psychic vision.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">For those of you who have been working solo, here is some very
        practical advice on how to find a seer. I am giving this advice here simply because placing an advertisement in
        your local paper or on the Internet for a seer (e.g., “Wanted: mystic with open astral vision interested in
        evoking spirits”) is not advisable.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Perhaps the best place to seek out a seer is at your local occult
        bookstore or supply shop. Simply “hang out” there for a while and look for people coming into the store who are
        interested in magick and divination. When you meet such a person introduce yourself and eventually ask such
        things as, “Do you do divinations? Are they usually correct? Do you have vivid dreams? Do you daydream
        frequently?”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If you are shy about meeting people, remember that you are not trying
        to “pick someone up” for a romantic rendezvous. You are looking for a co-worker. This should be clearly
        explained to the person if they are interested in working magickally with you. If the person is interested,
        perform your daily work with him or her sitting in your circle and see how the person responds. If there seems
        to be a good working relationship possible between you, if your selected seer seems appropriate, it is time to
        tell the person what his or her preparations will be.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">On the next page you will see a drawing attributed to Saint-Germain.
        On the left there is a male seer peering into a goblet that is being used as a magick mirror. The woman
        ritualist on the right holds a knife and wand. There is a fire burning directly below the face of the
        seer.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The inhalation of the smoke from the fire, which probably has incense,
        will cause a change in the blood chemistry of the seer. Also notice that it is possible that the ritualist is
        using the wand to strike the seer. This combination of pain and lack of oxygen combines to alter the
        consciousness of the seer and allow him to more easily observe the sights within the magick mirror.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As the illustration indicates, and as my personal experience and the
        experience of my students shows, an altered state of consciousness is a necessity for the seer. This can be
        accomplished in a number of ways. A mild hypnotic trance, perhaps induced via self-hypnosis, will suffice. If a
        person is not an alcoholic nor allergic to liquor, that person may be allowed to drink to a state of mild
        intoxication&mdash;no sloppy drunks, please.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There are many natural and synthetic drugs that will alter your
        consciousness. Although I do not advocate the use of any drug that is not specifically prescribed for you by a
        licensed doctor, it would be foolish of me to think that none of my students use what are known as
        “recreational” drugs. I am not going to describe their usage to alter your consciousness for magickal purposes
        because if you don’t already know how they affect you, I am not going to suggest that you try them to find out.
        I will say that some people have told me of great success when they have chemicalized themselves.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Ritualized induction of small amounts of pain, such as implied in the
        drawing, can also affect your consciousness. The small amounts of pain cause various hormones to flow throughout
        the bloodstream, and these hormones affect the brain-mind complex. There are drawings at least as far back as
        Pompeii showing ritual scourging. Some Wiccan groups use this as part of certain rituals. Pain is part of
        spiritual practices in some shamanistic cultures. Even some very mainstream Christian sects have used and use
        hair shirts and self-flagellation. I personally have not found such techniques useful, but there are those who
        have found them effective.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It is believed that many of the visions experienced by seers have been
        induced by the “Demon CO.” Here, CO is the chemical name for carbon monoxide, the result of fires or incense
        using up the oxygen in a room. When using incense always be sure to have fresh oxygen coming into the room
        through an open window or door. Still, the odor of the incense, especially if burned near the seer, can have a
        remarkable effect on the consciousness of this person. Sexual activity is another means of changing hormonal
        balance and affecting the brain-mind complex, but that will be discussed in another lesson. Still another way to
        alter the consciousness is by denying sleep for several days. There are other methods, too. You can probably
        think of several. In any event, allow the seer the choice of which method(s) he or she wishes to use, and with
        which you are both comfortable, to alter his or her consciousness. If there is any possible concern, the seer
        should have a medical exam first to be sure that nothing done could possibly damage the seer’s health.</span>

    <div class="calibre13">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Please note that none of the methods mentioned, if done with care,
        will hurt a healthy person. Further note that these practices have been done for thousands of years safely, and
        are still being done in shamanic cultures. However, also note that nobody is forcing you to do anything. If you
        try to actually perform evocative magick, using methods that are illegal or legal, neither the author,
        publisher, nor distributors of this course assume or will have any responsibility for your foolishness or
        disregard for the law and your health. The following rituals and explanations are presented as educational so

          <span class="bold1">PART FOUR</span>
        </span></span></h1>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <h2 class="calibre29"><span class="calibre30">
        <span class="bold1">Preparing for the Evocation</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">There are two other things that you need to obtain for this ritual
        other than your normal tools and the triangle of the art. The first is a set of two candleholders with stems
        long enough that they may be held by the seer while he or she looks into the magick mirror. Alternatively, you
        may obtain candle stands which reach the floor and are about three to four feet tall or more, depending upon the
        height of the seer. Needless to say, the latter are far more expensive. If you do get the ones that can be hand
        held, make sure that they have wide enough drip protectors so that the seer is not shocked by hot wax suddenly
        falling on his or her hands. This will also help prevent you from having to scrape wax off your floor or ironing
        it out of your carpet. As another alternative, two small tables can be used on which the smaller candle stands
        may be placed.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The second necessary item is the seal of the entity you wish to evoke.
        For this you must get a copy of the <span class="italic">Goetia</span>. Each seal represents and gives power to
        deal with an associated entity called a “spirit.” To determine which spirit to call and which seal to use you
        will need to look through the book and see which powers each spirit offers.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Let us say, for example, that you have reached a point in your life
        where you do not wish to be bothered by other people and their problems. You want to be alone. This is the true
        meaning of invisibility when described in the grimoires. Invisibility does not mean that you will become
        transparent, but that others act as if you are not there. So, looking through the descriptions of the spirits
        you find the name Bael (pronounced “Bah-ehl”).</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Bael is said to have the power to “maketh thee to go Invisible . . .
        He appeareth in divers shapes, sometimes like a Cat, sometimes like a Toad, and sometimes like a Man, and
        sometimes all these forms at once [!]. He speaketh hoarsely.” Furthermore, we are told that the seal must be
        worn like a necklace by the seer “or else he [Bael] will not do thee homage.” The seal of Bael is shown on the
        next page.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It may be drawn on paper as per the lesson on talismans. A string
        needs to be attached so that it may go around the seer’s neck, but it must be long enough so that without
        removing the string from around his or her neck, the seer may pick it up and look at it.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Set up the temple as usual. Place the triangle of the art outside the
        circle in the east. A chair may be placed in the east within the area of the circle for the seer if you feel
        that the seer may need it. Both of you should be robed and the seer should wear the seal. The two candleholders
        should be in the east on either side of the chair (if there is a chair) or to either side of the space where the
        seer will stand. The candles in them should not be lit. You will also want a pencil or pen and some paper to
        write down any message the seer may give you.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre2"><img alt="178" src="images/000161.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre12"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">The Seal of Bael</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre13">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The seer should be in the east of the circle, facing east. There
        should be incense near the seer so that he or she will inhale much of the smoke.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Perform the Opening by Watchtower. As you do so the seer should pay no
        attention to the ritual. It is the seer’s task to stare at and contemplate the seal. The chosen method to alter
        the consciousness of the seer should already have begun with the exception of self-hypnosis, which should wait
        until after the opening. If you have enough people participating in the evocation, one should be assigned the
        task of making sure that incense is always flowing toward the seer. Make sure that when casting the circle you
        walk outside the seer so that the seer is definitely within the magickal circle.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">After the Opening the operator should stand behind the seer and light, or have someone
        light the seer’s candles. Put the candles in the seer’s hands. This will force the seer to drop the seal. Make
        sure that when it hangs down the seal is facing out. If you are using floor-standing candleholders, or ones on
        tables, tell the seer to let go of the seal and stare into the magick mirror. Speak to the seer in a smooth,
        comforting voice, saying:<div class="calibre20">
          <blockquote class="calibre21">
            <div class="calibre19">
              <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">“Stare deeply into the mirror. Do not
                    look at it, but</span>
                  <span class="italic"><span class="bold">into</span></span>
                  <span class="bold">it. Move the candles so that you can see yourself, but so that you do not directly
                    see the reflection of the candle’s flames. Stare deep . . . deeper . . . deeper . . .”</span></span>

    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Now it is time to do the first conjuration. When a spirit’s name is
        mentioned and is in parentheses, you should use the name of the spirit you are actually evoking. In this
        example, you will see (BAEL), but if you are evoking Botis, you would vibrate BOTIS instead of Bael. All
        capitalized names/ words of power should be vibrated.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">It is not necessary to have a seer; you can act as the seer yourself.
        However, it is much easier to have a seer so that one of you can perform the ritual while the other concentrates
        on the magick mirror.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Also, you will have probably noticed that I did not tell you the
        appropriate incense to use, nor the appropriate time to do this ritual, nor the appropriate color symbolism.
        There is an important reason for this. The purpose of this course is not to make you “sort of” familiar with
        magick. It is not to have you read and be somewhat familiar with stacks of books on the subject. It is the
        purpose of this course to make you a practicing magician. Should you merely be able to follow books, you will
        never be more than what a “hack writer” is to literature. And frankly, a few Joyces, LeGuins, and Kerouacs are
        worth a thousand formula novelists. This is not to say that there isn’t a place for numerous romance novels or
        comic book magicians&mdash;there is. But it is not what I hope this course will produce.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Yes, the time this ritual is performed is important, the color
        symbolism is important, the choice of incense important. But at this time I leave it to you to figure out the
        details. Go back over these lessons and you should have no problem doing so. As a hint, compare what the spirit
        can offer you with the Talismanic Magick chart. From there you should be able to get the planet and Sephira. The
        rest should be obvious. If it is not, start this entire course over, for you have not really understood the
        information presented to a level where you are ready to do evocations. Go through these lessons again and I’m
        sure you’ll understand the concepts and be able to effortlessly figure these things out.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The <span class="italic">Goetia</span> has the seals, names, and
        descriptions of seventy-two different spirits, each having various talents and powers that can be shared with
        you. Much of the book, it is sad to say, has picked up the junk and excrescences of centuries of repression and
        stupidity. Some sections of the <span class="italic">Goetia</span> refer to other books of <span
          class="italic">The Lesser Key of Solomon</span> (of which the <span class="italic">Goetia</span> is but one).
        When I originally wrote <span class="italic">Modern Magick</span>, I wrote, “Unfortunately, there is only one
        known source for the Complete Lesser Key, and it is rather expensive and of poor quality.” Thankfully, new
        versions have appeared and are valuable contributions to magickal literature.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">However, with the instructions in this course and the commonly
        available editions of the <span class="italic">Goetia</span>, you can have virtually years of practical work and
        experimentation. See the bibliography at the end of this chapter for suggested versions of the grimoires used
        for Solomonic evocations.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">One of the most commonly available editions of the <span
          class="italic">Goetia</span> also refers to itself as “the Book of Evil Spirits.” This, however, is quite
        misleading, for in this book you are dealing with energies or forces that take on a type of personality. But
        they are no more “evil forces” than electricity, another force, is good or evil. Electricity can be used to kill
        people or light up the night. It’s the same energy, but can be seen as good or evil depending upon the use that
        the energy is put to. Similarly, the spirits in the <span class="italic">Goetia</span> are neither good nor
        evil. In fact, they have no free will and can only do what is in their nature.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Even though evil is not an issue here, karma is. Even something that
        superficially seems to be positive may lead to karmically negative results. So before acting on the advice of
        any Goetic spirit, be sure to do a divination in order to be positive that you will not be performing any magick
        or action that would unknowingly lead to deleterious results. Remember, it won’t be the spirits who experience
        karma from your actions, it will be you who acquires karma.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Since this is not a course in Goetic magick I will not be giving you
        seventy-two examples, one for each spirit. Rather, at this time I again urge you to obtain a copy of the <span
          class="italic">Goetia</span> and simply follow the pattern given in the ritual above. Replace the name of BAEL
        with the name of the spirit from the book you wish to evoke. Use the appropriate seal as given in that
        text.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Until you can obtain a copy of the book, or if you merely wish to try
        out some Goetic magick and see if it appeals to you, on the following pages are a few samples of Goetic spirits,
        their seals, description, and purposes.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre13">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Above is the seal of the spirit <span class="bold">AMON</span>. Amon
        is great in power and is also said to be very stern. He looks like a wolf with the tail of a serpent and breath
        of fire. At the command of the magician, Amon will change to look like a man with a raven’s head. Sometimes
        there are “dog’s teeth” (i.e., fangs) in the head of this raven. Amon will give you information on all things
        past and things yet to be. Having a neutral nature, he can help reconcile differences between friends. However,
        he can also cause feuds. Needless to say, care must be taken in asking for what you desire of Amon!</span></div>

    <div class="calibre13">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Above is the seal of the spirit <span class="bold">BUER</span>. Buer
        should only be evoked during the astrological sign of Sagittarius and appears as the Sagittarian centaur. He
        teaches science and philosophy, including such things as mathematics, ethics, logic, and physics. His specialty
        is teaching the secret magickal and medicinal powers of herbs and plants. He also has healing powers, especially
        over psychological pain.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Below is the seal of the spirit <span class="bold">BOTIS</span>. At
        first he will appear as an ugly viper, but on the command of the magician changes into the shape of a man with
        “great teeth” (fangs, again), two horns, and carrying a sword of exquisite sharpness and brightness. When
        evoked, he can offer things similar to Amon (note the similarity with the change of appearance and the fangs).
        Botis is said to tell all things from the past and those things yet to be. He can also reconcile disagreements
        between friends and foes.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As a historical document the <span class="italic">Goetia</span> is
        fascinating. Several “spirits” are clearly nothing more than deities of earlier cultures. Thus, the spirit
        Astaroth is nothing more than a form of the goddess Astaroth, also known as Astarte and Isis. Revealing a
        Christian masculine bias, the spirit Astaroth changes gender and becomes a male! This certainly helps to
        validate the sociological theory that the gods and goddesses of any culture become the demons of the following
        culture. And even goddesses became male demons.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I recently saw a program on television wherein the studio was
        decorated to appear as a cave. The speaker was putting forth some bizarre hysteria about how a fantasy
        role-playing game was resulting in demon possession and people leaving Christianity. Since this program was on a
        “religious” (i.e., Protestant Christian Evangelical) network, the purpose of this program had to be only to
        appeal to the paranoia of those who already believe in one form of Christianity. However, another Christian
        writer, theologian, and radio personality says that Christians cannot be “demon possessed.” Therefore, this TV
        program presented a philosophy not even in accord with other Christian apologists. Of course, one good way to
        keep large numbers of people under your control is to keep instilling fear into them. This seems to be a major
        function of “Christian” broadcasting. In any event, I disagree totally with the TV program’s content as being
        nothing more than irrational, fear-inducing, paranoid superstition.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">To be fair, much of occultism is also hidden in the stupidity of paranoia and superstition.
        A book I read on occult topics used the <span class="italic">National Enquirer</span> and a Hare Krishna
        magazine as sources for information. And even if the author did not understand that the <span
          class="italic">National Enquirer</span> is not necessarily considered an example of journalistic excellence,
        he should have checked for other sources, too. He also should have realized that the Hare Krishna magazine would
        present things in order to make their organization look good, truth and reality notwithstanding. So I repeat

        letters: T.F.Y.Q.A. This, I explain, stands for “Think For Yourself. Question Authority.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">By now you might be thinking, “What does all this have to do with
        magickal evocation and the <span class="italic">Goetia</span>?” Well, I want to tell you that I like to think
        that I am not paranoid, but I have in my possession something that scared me. Although I doubt demon possession
        is the result of playing simple fantasy role-playing games (RPG), I have a RPG from several years ago that
        features evocations from the <span class="italic">Goetia,</span> and playing pieces which are nothing less than
        miniature versions of the Seals of the Spirits from that book! Although this game had a rather small circulation
        and certainly gives no danger to trained occultists, it could have been a problem for a person who has latent
        magickal abilities and spends a lot of time looking at the game pieces. That type of person, with no magickal
        training or protective preparations, could be quite shocked upon seeing a weird figure in a reflective surface.
        Such a scare could hurt an unknowing person’s psyche and grasp on reality. It could be possible that a few
        people may become obsessed with certain thoughts and ideas, whether they be along occult, magickal, or other
        lines. For a person who is magickally trained&mdash;such as you are becoming by following the teachings of this
        course&mdash;obsession or possession is not a problem. For untrained, easily influenced people, care is needed.
        That is why I’m glad that copies of the game I possess received little circulation. In fact, I recently went
        into a store that specializes in selling RPGs and even has tables set up for people to play. Nobody, not even
        the owners, had heard of the game. With this, we end our study of the <span class="italic">Goetia</span>.</span>

        </span></span></h1>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Before moving on to discuss material from a second book of evocation,
        I’d like to pause and share another ritual of protection. The theoretical and philosophical focus of this course
        has been on modern Kabalistic theory, what I have somewhat facetiously called the “WASP Kabalah.” This system is
        based on earlier mystical Judaic traditions, which, in turn, had been based on even earlier Semitic,
        pre-Semitic, and non-Semitic sources.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In contradistinction to the WASP Kabalah is what I have called the
        “Kosher Kabalah,” a Kabalistic philosophy that has eschewed many later influences that had de-Judaified
        Kabalistic traditions. I am personally delighted to see a growing Jewish Kabalistic resurgence in both the West
        and the Middle East. It is hoped that as a result many previously rare and untranslated or poorly translated
        texts will become available to imperfect students such as myself. As an example of this need, one of the most
        important Kabalistic magickal texts, a book on talismans known as the <span class="italic">Sepher Ratziel</span>
        , to my knowledge has not been translated into English. I searched out and found a Hebrew copy of it at the
        University of Judaism in Los Angeles, California. It was about sixty years old and in poor condition. The type
        used was somewhat dissimilar to the style most commonly used today. That, along with printing that cut off
        portions of letters, made the book impossible for me to try and translate.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Another important book not yet translated is by the famous Rabbi Isaac
        Luria. It is called <span class="italic">The Revolution of Souls</span> and is about reincarnation. Much of his
        theory has been presented in these lessons, which I learned from second-hand sources. Perhaps some true scholar
        of a mystical bent will try his or her hand at the necessary task of translating these two books, as well as
        many of the others which sit in waiting for a time when they may illuminate the world.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Another book often talked about is the <span
          class="italic">Picatrix</span>. It has a great deal to do with talismanic magick. It was finally translated
        into English in two volumes, the second volume appearing in October 2008.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The reason I am again talking about the Kosher Kabalah is that many
        people have asked me if there are any uniquely Kosher Kabalistic rituals. Of course there are, and just before
        the publication of the first edition of <span class="italic">Modern Magick</span> I found a good protective
        ritual of this sort. It is based totally on Jewish sources, specifically on the <span class="italic">Sepher
          Yetzirah</span>.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In the <span class="italic">Sepher Yetzirah</span> we are told that
        God sealed the directions of space with various permutations of three letters of the Ultimate Name, those three
        letters being Yud, Heh, and Vahv. Using this as a basis I present a ritual that can be used in place of the Rose
        Cross Ritual. I call it:</span></div>

          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">During the giving of this blessing, the priest&mdash;or in
              modern Jewish synagogues, the rabbi or cantor&mdash;is supposed to have his hands in the position of
              blessing shown on a previous page. Many synagogues don’t include the use of the hand position any more,
              and I can understand why. As I discussed earlier, most modern Jewish traditions are not involved in
              mysticism and magick, and this is a very magickal technique.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In this position, the hands are supposed to be&mdash;not merely
              represent&mdash;windows into heaven. There are five points this way: the grouped outer fingers on each
              hand, the grouped inner fingers on each hand, and the touching thumbs. This is supposed to indicate a
              latticework and references a passage in the “Song of Songs” (often mistakenly called the “Song of
              Solomon”) 2:9 that reads, “My beloved . . . standeth behind our wall, he looketh in through the windows,
              he peereth through the lattice.” It also can be seen as the letter “Shin,” an abbreviation for Sha-dai,
              one of the names of God. And it even represents the four “corners” where Asherah, the female half of God
              and who was later thought of as God’s bride, is said to rest.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Returning to the quotation from the “Song of Songs,” you might
              ask who is this “my beloved,” who “peereth through the lattice”? It is, of course, none other than God
              Himself. And it is believed&mdash;well, it used to be believed&mdash;that during this blessing God looked
              through the hands of the priest toward the congregation! Now that’s magick, indeed. That is one reason
              that during this benediction many Jews will bow their heads. It’s not proper to look back at God. In fact,
              there’s a superstition that if you do so, you will be blinded.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In the Hebrew of the blessing, there are thirteen instances of
              the letter “Yud.” As you remember, thirteen equals unity and love. Therefore, the use of this blessing
              indicates God’s love for the people. According to one of the great Jewish rabbis, known as the Rambam, the
              blessing is not dependent upon the priests, but rather on God. So feel free to use it as a
              blessing.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It is because there are natural magickal methods in this grimoire,
        along with the lack of appeals to Jesus and the Trinity, which gives internal evidence of an earlier date for
        the <span class="italic">Greater Key</span> than the <span class="italic">Lesser Key</span>. In fact, the
        earliest written versions of the <span class="italic">Greater Key</span> date from the fifteenth or sixteenth
        centuries, while the earliest copies of the <span class="italic">Lesser Key</span> are from the seventeenth
        century. Of course, oral versions of both of the books may go back much further, and earlier manuscript forms of
        these books may still be discovered. This did happen with a grimoire called the <span
          class="italic">Picatrix</span>, which was only translated into English in 2008. It was thought to be a typical
        example of writing from the Middle Ages. Recent discoveries show it to be a translation of a much earlier Arabic
        work.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As with our study of the <span class="italic">Lesser Key</span>, it is
        not my purpose to recopy the entire <span class="italic">Greater Key of Solomon</span> here. However, the
        evocational conjurations are similar in form to those of the <span class="italic">Lesser Key</span> as given
        earlier in this lesson. Thus, you could use the evocations from the <span class="italic">Lesser Key</span> by
        changing the phrase “spirit Bael,” as in the earlier example, for “angel So-and-So.” I know that this may
        infuriate some purists, but the technique and philosophy are the same. If you want to drag yourself through
        five, single-spaced pages of evocations, such as are given in the <span class="italic">Greater Key</span>, you
        may be my guest!</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In the <span class="italic">Greater Key</span> we are again confronted
        with a puzzle to our understanding, a puzzle obviously created to fool those without training. Between Books One
        and Two of the <span class="italic">Greater Key</span> is a section filled with “pentacles” and how they can
        “bring” you various powers and abilities. This seems to imply that they are actually talismans. However, if you
        go through Book One and actually study the evocations, you will see that the magician is told to show the
        pentacles to the spirit that appears and “demand all that he shall wish from the King of Spirits.” As you can
        see, implying that these symbolic figures are talismans is a blind to prevent their true potential from falling
        into the hands of the untrained and unprepared.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Below is a pentacle associated with the Sun. Its purpose is to free
        you from the thought patterns that keep you from achieving your desires. The evocation should be done on the day
        and in the hour of the Sun. If so done, the entity that appears will tell you how to break your (mental) bonds
        and be free. In your evocation, use the term “Lord Yud-Heh-Vahv-Heh” instead of “spirit Bael.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre2"><img alt="189" src="images/000174.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Below is a pentacle for controlling the spirits of Venus. It would be
        good for any of the purposes listed under Venus on the Talismanic Magick chart. You would want to use the name
        of the appropriate archangel instead of “spirit Bael.” Evoke the spirit of Venus (the archangel, amongst others)
        and ask of it what you will as is appropriate to the planet. Of course, do the evocation during the hour of
        Venus, and, if possible, on the day of Venus.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre2"><img alt="190" src="images/000208.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Below is another pentacle associated with Venus. Its purpose is to
        invoke the spirit Yohn-ehl to give you information on how to obtain grace and honor. “Yohn-ehl” comes from the
        Hebrew outside the central figure: Yud, Vahv, Nun, Alef, and Lahmed.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre2"><img alt="191" src="images/000038.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Finally, the pentacle below is another one of Venus. Its purpose is to
        learn from the angel Monachiel how to attract love.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre2"><img alt="192" src="images/000083.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I wish to reiterate here that magickal evocation is not just working
        with your fantasies and imagination. Neither is it a type of Spiritism that seeks contact with any dead souls or
        entities that happen to be nearby. Rather, it is a very real method of making contact with entities on a higher
        level of existence. They are always there. It is usually we who are not aware of them. In magickal evocation we
        not only become aware of them, but also choose with whom of the myriad of entities available we desire
        contact.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In the <span class="italic">Greater Key</span>, we obtain some
        specialized information that is not in the <span class="italic">Lesser Key</span>, and we can assume that it is
        specifically for use with <span class="italic">Greater Key</span> entities. When doing evocations from the <span
          class="italic">Greater Key</span> there is a slightly different method for employing the pentacle. After using
        the pentacle to focus your attention (don’t confuse this with your magickal tool&mdash;the Earth pentacle),
        cover the pentacle so that it cannot be seen. Usually a piece of black silk is used for this purpose. Then, when
        the entity appears in your magick mirror, show the pentacle to the entity. The result is that the entity will be
        bound by your will. We will use this technique in a similar way, but for another purpose, in a later
        lesson.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Before going on to another aspect of evocative magick, there is
        another book I wish to mention in passing. This is a book that was apparently used as a source book by a branch
        of the Golden Dawn known as the Alpha and Omega. The name of the book, which was translated by Mathers, is <span
          class="italic">The Grimoire of Armadel</span>.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This unusual book, though still in print, is mostly ignored by
        “magicians” because they do not understand, or dare not try, the magick of evocation. Its internal structure
        (references to Jesus throughout the book) indicates a later work than the <span class="italic">Greater
          Key</span>. In fact, some of the names of spirits in this book seem to be similar to those of both the <span
          class="italic">Lesser Key</span> and <span class="italic">Greater Key</span> and another work known as <span
          class="italic">The Arbatel of Magick</span>.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The seals or sigils in <span class="italic">The Grimoire of
          Armadel</span> are far more involved than most other works of this genre. Unless you buy the book and work to
        understand it, they are rather unusable. This book does not even bother to give outrageous methods to draw a
        magick circle. Rather it merely says to “see that the Circle be [correctly] formed according to the instructions
        we have [elsewhere] given.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The meanings of the seals, and the purposes for using them, are hidden
        in abstruse language. After reading this lesson you should be able to discern the meanings and see through the
        veils to the uninitiated. If you do buy (or already have) this book, simply remember that the purpose of
        evocative magick is to allow yourself to see into the astral plane and communicate with entities who can answer
        questions and give instructions according to their nature.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Although <span class="italic">The Grimoire of Armadel</span> does not
        have instructions on how to make the magickal circle, it does have the same kind of protection rituals and
        conjurations as given in other grimoires of this nature such as the <span class="italic">Greater Key</span> and
        <span class="italic">Lesser Key</span>. Curiously, this book also has some heavily disguised information on sex
        magick toward the end. (There will be more on sex magick in the next lesson.)</span></div>

      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Unless you are totally new to magick and occultism, you have probably
        heard of entities known as elementals. And, if you have a little more knowledge, you probably know that there
        are different types of elementals. Each type is associated with a different element:</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">The elemental spirits of Earth are the Gnomes. <br
          class="calibre5" />The elemental spirits of Air are the Sylphs. <br class="calibre5" />The elemental spirits
        of Water are the Undines. <br class="calibre5" />The elemental spirits of Fire are the Salamanders.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">These natural elementals are quite unique. Here, on the physical
        plane, everything is made of a combination of the elements, but the elementals are totally composed of only one
        element. Thus, they can rarely be seen on this plane except within their element. Salamanders can sometimes be
        seen weaving around a roaring fire. Sylphs can occasionally be seen as sparkles in the air on a clear
        day.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The proper place for describing entities whose main appearance is on
        other planes will come in another lesson. Further, the length of this course does not allow time for learning to
        do magick with the aid of the elementals. However, there is something that uses a creation similar to elementals
        and which forms an important part of your magickal curriculum. It is known as the creation of <span
          class="italic">artificial</span> elementals.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">An artificial elemental is something that you, by force of will and
        magickal techniques, create to do your Will. In a sense, this is a type of evocation. Another way of looking at
        artificial elementals is that they are a type of talismanic magick without the talisman. And . . . you already
        know how to make artificial elementals.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">An artificial elemental combines the force of a particular element
        with a temporary will or a direction created by yourself. Thus, if two of your friends were having a
        disagreement, you might wish to send them a bit of elemental Water to cool them off. Here you are combining an
        element (Water) with a purpose (calm friends).</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Perhaps you have a boyfriend or girlfriend who to your mind is not
        amorous enough. Sending that person some Fire (element) to increase their ardor (purpose) might do the trick.
        Similarly, if you are a manager with a lazy employee, sending some Fire (element) to increase the employee’s
        productivity (purpose) could be exactly what is needed to encourage the employee and enhance his or her
        work.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">An artificial elemental also has a type of rudimentary consciousness
        or sense of purpose. This is what you instill in it, as will be explained. Much as a cruise missile will move
        around objects in order to find its target, so, too, will an artificial elemental discover ways of achieving the
        goal you give it.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">This means that the amount of elemental energy you give it may not be equal to the task you
        assign it. If the energy is too little, the artificial elemental will not succeed in achieving its goal. If you
        give it more elemental energy than it needs, and do not tell it how to discharge that excess energy once the
        goal has been reached, an artificial elemental can become an unthinking (and sometimes uncontrollable) elemental
        force, sending out its undirected energy at anything and anyone, including its creator. Therefore, when making
        an artificial elemental for a particular purpose, you should pay close attention to the following concepts:<div
          class="calibre24">
          <div class="calibre25">
            <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">1. You should have firmly in mind what you want the

          <div class="calibre25">
            <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">2. You should not have the artificial elemental affect
                another person without that person’s permission. In the above situations (a) employees tacitly give
                approval for managers to affect them to encourage their productivity; (b) the person was already a
                boyfriend or girlfriend and thus what you would be doing would be to strengthen something already in
                existence&mdash;you are not affecting a new or unknown person; (c) you are not affecting the outcome of
                the argument, merely calming the emotions associated with it so that the two can more easily settle the
                differences between them.</span></blockquote>

                artificial elemental would be based on the element Fire and would have the purpose of creating the fiery
                emotions of fear and paranoia in any who would seek to intrude in an area such as your home without
                permission or honorable intent. Be sure to give it a dispersal date and time. And if your container is
                hollow, open it on that date and at that time to allow the imprisoned artificial elemental to
                disperse.</span></div>

            knowledge of that entity. The more you know about the entity, the more likely you will have success. Very
            frequently the entities chosen are gods from various pantheons, archangels, or spirits from various
            grimoires. As a <span class="italic">general</span> rule&mdash;and one that works well for
            safety&mdash;“invoke the higher and evoke the lower.” That is, invoke deities, archangels, and angels. Evoke
            lower spirits. You must learn all you can about the particular entity you will be invoking, including the
            physical position (if any) in which the entity is most frequently described. Physically assuming that
            position, as well as visualizing yourself in this position is known as “assuming a God-form.” Appropriate
            colors and scents should also be around, and poetry or songs and even dances dedicated to the entity should
            be performed. Sometimes, words that are fairly meaningless to us are repeated over and over, like a mantra.
            These are frequently (and wrongly) called “the Barbarous Names of Evocation.” Together, this combination of
            calling a particular entity and using devices to alter the consciousness of the magician produces a
            condition that allows an entity to temporarily displace the consciousness of the magician.</span>

            As with evocational magick, invocational rituals are group acts. Others are needed to take notes or ask
            questions of the invoked entity. It will later be up to all the people present whether or not they wish to
            follow the advice of the entity. The group may also wish to ask questions of the entity in order to prove
            the identity of the entity. This method was explained earlier in this lesson. Sometimes, however, magicians
            will do an invocation by themselves not for communication, but in order to obtain qualities of the entity
            invoked. For example, a soldier might invoke a warrior deity before going into battle.</span></blockquote>

            to stay for long. Sometimes an additional rite is added here. This rite will be discussed in the next
            lesson. Then the entity will freely choose to go and the magician’s normal consciousness will automatically
            return. During the entire ritual, from after the Opening by Watchtower, the Earth pentacle&mdash;a symbol of
            the physical plane&mdash;should be covered with a opaque black cloth, preferably of silk. If the entity does
            not leave as quickly as desired, or (as I have seen happen) if people in the circle start to have a bad
            reaction from the extraterrestrial contact, unveil the pentacle and show it to the eyes of the
            magician/invoked entity. It will depart to its own abodes. Also, give the license to depart as in
            evocational rituals.<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">During the time when the non-physical
                entity is invoked, the consciousness of the magician is not simply gone. Rather, one of two things
                happen. It may stay on the astral plane near the body of the magician. Otherwise, it may go throughout
                the astral plane. Sometimes the consciousness of the magician may meet other entities on the astral
                plane, and the report of experiences by the magician during this period may be of more value to the
                group than the actual invocation.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Is that not beautiful? Versions of it can be found in some editions of
        <span class="italic">The Lesser Key of Solomon: Goetia</span> and in Crowley’s <span
          class="italic">Magick</span>.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The reason I am not presenting an invocational ritual in full is not
        because it is dangerous. If you have practiced the rituals given so far in this course and follow the
        instructions given, you will have no problem. What I wish to present to you is the idea that rituals are not
        static and unchanging. Is there an entity you wish to invoke? Do the research on that entity, learn all you can
        about the entity. Find poetry dedicated to that entity or write some yourself. To be successful you must become
        totally involved with that god, archangel, or spirit. And then you must truly want the entity to come to you. To
        do this you must “inflame thyself with prayer” aimed toward that particular entity.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I want to give you as much information as possible in this course.
        With evocation and invocation, this task is rather incomplete. This is because the very nature of magickal
        evocation requires the use of other books, and the nature of invocations requires a great deal of work on your
        own.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Although these types of magick are very dramatic, you can be a
        successful magician and never use them. If you do desire to practice these techniques you will have to obtain
        the appropriate books and do the necessary work.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Remember, one of the goals of this course is to allow you to pick up
        any book on magick and be able to understand it and work its system. Had I not told you the inner secrets of
        magickal evocation and invocation, several books might not have been as clear to you as they could be. Thus,
        this lesson serves its purpose.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The instructions on how to create an artificial elemental are a more
        complete set of magickal instructions. You now know how to create an artificial elemental for any purpose you
        desire. Although the ritual looks short, in fact it requires much time and effort. It requires that you know the
        material in the eight previous lessons of this course.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">You needed to know the correspondences with the elements. You needed
        to know the Watchtower ritual, which means that you needed to know the Pentagram and Hexagram rituals.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">You needed to know how to generate elemental energy, which also
        requires the knowledge of elemental pore breathing.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In short, this course is cumulative. I cannot stress this too much. To
        achieve success in magick requires dedication to study and practice. If you want to talk about magick, I think
        you will enjoy this entire course. If you want to be a magician, a real practicing magician, you must practice
        the exercises and techniques and rituals given in these lessons. There is no secret pill or formula to become a
        wizard overnight. Now is the time to get to work if you have not already begun.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">“Magick is not something you do, magick is something you are.” I have
        said this over and over to students and I have tried to make it clear in these lessons. True magicians realize
        that since they can work magick and affect (and effect) their lives, they are really free to do anything they
        wish. True magicians also realize that they are responsible for their actions. Thus freedom and responsibility
        are signs of a magickal lifestyle. This attitude is also the basis for a magician’s view of sex.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As a magician, I believe that every adult is entitled to have sex any
        way he or she desires, as long as it does not involve the coercion of anyone else. If you are straight, gay,
        celibate, or polyamorous; if you are into BD/SM or just about anything else, that’s fine with me ... as long as
        you and your partner(s) are adults and you do not coerce someone else into something they do not wish to do.
        Freedom, responsibility, and honesty should be a magician’s guide. For that matter, these ideas should guide any
        person’s actions.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Unfortunately, numerous organizations of dubious worth coerce people
        into various sexual situations. One organization I am familiar with had the leader determine sexual partners.
        This included having to be in an adjacent room while your “significant other” had intercourse with another
        person. This allowed you to hear every sound.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Another organization I know of preaches strict celibacy. Married
        members are only allowed to have sex once a month, and that is only for the purpose of procreation. However, I
        know that several leading members of this organization do not follow this rule. In fact, one of the vice
        presidents of this organization, a man who taught celibacy, had a torrid affair with a woman I know. The
        organization is aware of his extracurricular activities and moves him from so-called temple to temple but does
        not expel him.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Another organization’s leader told several members to get divorces,
        which they did. This leader also encouraged romantic affairs but was against marriage. The leader’s actions
        destroyed several families.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Why do these organizations and their leaders try
          to control people’s sex lives?</span></span></div>

          <div class="calibre16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Brainwashing, You Say?</span></span></div>
          <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
          <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Lots of people talk about brainwashing. They claim that somebody
              or some group brainwashed them or another person. Often, when used as an accusation against a group or
              individual, it is about as realistic as one magician calling another a “black magician” simply because
              they do something the first magician wouldn’t do. In most cases the claim of brainwashing is just hogwash
              meant to emotionally manipulate people listening to the claims.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Some people claim that brainwashing isn’t really feasible.
              However, according to military studies, brainwashing is real and possible. The U.S. military has studied
              this in order to prepare American soldiers to resist brainwashing attempts used against them.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Real brainwashing is far more complex than simply hypnotizing
              someone. There are five things necessary for brainwashing, and to be successful all must be used. To make
              you aware of what is required for brainwashing, and through this information help you avoid it should
              someone or some group attempt it in your life, here are the five elements of real brainwashing:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="calibre5">
            <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></span></blockquote>
          </div>
          <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">1) <span class="italic">Removal from environment of
                influence.</span> You are normally in an environment with friends, family, coworkers&mdash;people you
              know and who give you mental and emotional support. Removing you from this supportive environment is
              usually the first part of the brainwashing process. Forced sexual activity may be a part of the new
              environment.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">2) <span class="italic">Sleep deprivation.</span> This is a
              change of routine and the lack of sleep keeps you tired and lowers inhibitions.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">3) <span class="italic">Pain with disagreement.</span> If you
              disagree in some way with those attempting to brainwash you, you receive a punishment out of proportion
              with the disagreement. For example, if you refuse to move at the speed they want, you are kept in a dark
              room for three days.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">4) <span class="italic">Pleasure with agreement.</span> The
              amount of reward for agreement is also out of proportion to the agreement, but opposite to the way you are
              treated when you disagree. For example, agreeing to give some secret gives you a small, extra serving of
              food or the chance to go outside for a few minutes.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Lots of pain for disagreement and a tiny amount of pleasure for
              agreement results in justification of behavior along the lines desired by the brainwashers.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">5) <span class="italic">Change in biochemistry.</span> Although
              this can be caused by sleep deprivation, physical punishment, or the use of drugs, it’s most often induced
              by a change of diet.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Brainwashing will change your attitude and point of view.
              Contrary to popular belief, however, it’s not always negative. For example, militaries use these
              techniques to turn ordinary people into erstwhile soldiers willing to charge into a barrage of bullets
              when common sense would say (to quote Monty Python), “Run away! Run away!”</span></div>
        </div>
      </blockquote>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The most personal and private thing we possess is our sexuality. It is
        impossible to get physically closer to another person than during sexual relations. Romeo Void’s 1982 song,
        <span class="italic">Never Say Never</span>, exemplifies this idea with the repeated lyric, “I might like you
        better if we slept together.” Sex is totally involved in our psyches. Control a person’s sex life and you can
        control the person’s psyche; you control the person. Control of a person’s sex life is part of what has been
        called brainwashing.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Perhaps you remember Patty Hearst. In 1974 she was kidnapped by a
        group with whose philosophies she did not agree. She later became an active member of the group. One of the
        means used to accomplish this change was the control of her sex life. She was forced to have sexual intercourse
        with several people, including having group sex. This was one of the ways her will was broken down until she
        lost her own ideals and adopted those of her captors. This is not an attempt to philosophically side with Ms.
        Hearst or her captors, it is only to show how control of sex can be a part of brainwashing techniques.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In the case of the first group I mentioned earlier, controlling the
        sex life of the members allowed the control of the members’ minds. Thus, although the organization is supposed
        to teach each member how to be an unique, independent individual, everyone tended to freely accept the commands
        of the leader. Also, the members gave large amounts of money to the organization, much of which went to the
        leader. Eventually, the leader gained enough money and property. He retired from the group. It split into
        smaller groups&mdash;one of which tried to link itself to the philosophy of the <span class="italic">Star
          Wars</span> movies!&mdash;and, to the best of my knowledge, eventually disappeared. Some small offshoots may
        remain.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Concerning the second group, when its leader died, various temples and
        their leaders, in spite of claiming advanced spirituality, fought for power, control, and the group’s money. The
        group split up. Some of the resulting groups still have power/ money/sex-oriented leaders. Others actually have
        developed into very spiritual groups.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The desire for celibacy by the members, combined with the inability to
        be perfect at it, results in some of the members feeling guilty over their failure. They end up working harder
        to raise funds for the organization in an attempt to make up for their perceived failure. It quickly becomes
        easy for them to believe the “truths” of some of the leaders who proceed to teach the members how to lie and
        steal. In fact, this group was convicted in court of “wrongful death,” libel, and kidnapping. A spiritual
        organization, indeed!</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The third organization was totally in thrall to its leader. The leader
        dressed up in bizarre clothes with built-in light bulbs and she made incredibly amateurish videos of the group’s
        (i.e., her) theories. These videos are so bad that they are unintentionally hilarious. Yet, like controlled
        robots, none of the leader’s followers seem to care or realize how foolish they look. The more people laugh at
        them when they dress up in clothes that are half Renaissance, half science-fiction, the more they become
        dedicated to the leader who controlled their lives. The leader died in the mid-1990s, and I lost interest in
        observing the group after her death.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The reason I am giving you these prefatory notes is to point out that
        there are organizations that attempt to control your sex life as a means of controlling your will. On a lower
        level, there are groups that use a guise of spirituality or learning in order to obtain people for sexual
        exploitation. These types of groups exist in all fields of endeavor, including the study of magick. Some
        “magickal” groups are nothing more than a cover for one of two things: gaining sexual partners and gaining power
        over others.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It is indeed a shame that some people feel so weak and helpless that
        in order to overcome these feelings they must seek to have power over, and control, other people. It is also a
        shame that some people need “spiritual” façades in order to gain sexual partners.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If you are working with a group of people and it seems obvious to you
        that sex is going to become a part of that group’s activities, <span class="italic"><span
            class="bold">stop!</span></span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Ask yourself if you really want to become involved with these
        particular people in this particular way. If these are not people you wish to become sexually involved with, get
        out before they make a strong effort to possibly take control of your life and will.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">And please do not think that you are immune to brainwashing or too
        smart for it. Many cults get a large percentage of their recruits from college campuses. I have seen very bright
        and intelligent people go and “investigate” cults only to become trapped in cultic double-think and end up as
        pawns of a ruthless leader.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It is because the control of a person’s sex life can be used to get
        control over that person’s life in general that I am taking so much time discussing brainwashing and cults. For
        the true sign of a magician is freedom of thought and freedom of will. You will never be a magician if you are
        under some cult’s mind control.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Further, brainwashing may not be what you think. You do not have to be
        tortured and berated day after day, although that is part of one method. Most groups today use a gradual process
        that induces you to ignore logic and accept the group’s “double-speak.” In the bibliography that comes with this
        lesson I am listing a few books that describe the signs of cults and their brainwashing techniques. I urge you
        to study them before joining any group that uses sexuality as part of its teachings.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">There are several different aspects to sexual magick, and it is
        difficult to divide them into categories, as they overlap a great deal. Even so, it is necessary to make loose
        categories in order to discuss the subject. Please understand that these divisions are just for communication’s
        sake, and other writers may not follow them.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">I divide the types of magick that use the sexual energies as a fundamental source into
        three groups:<div class="calibre24">
          <div class="calibre25">
            <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">1. <span class="italic">Thought Control.</span> This is
                a method of controlling sexual energy via the mind during sexual excitation and orgasm. This may not
                sound difficult, but it actually requires you to concentrate on something while you are in a state of
                consciousness where directed thinking is very difficult. This will be explained later, including how to
                overcome the problem.</span></blockquote>
          </div>
          <div class="calibre25">
            <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">2. <span class="italic">Inner Alchemy.</span> This is a
                type of White Magick that could be called White Sex Magick. It is an important part of Taoist alchemy
                (also called Taoist yoga) and Tantric sexual yoga. Some purists may be upset that I am introducing
                Oriental elements into this course. However, I’m very eclectic. Even before the writings of Blavatsky,
                Oriental mysticism has been incorporated into Western mystical philosophy and practice. Even the Golden
                Dawn took much from the East. This includes both the ideas of karma and the “Tatvic Tides,” a system
                that can help in understanding and working with the magickal elements. Also, it is unfortunately true
                that with the denunciation of sex for anything but procreation as taught by the Christian church for
                over 1500 years, much of Western sex magick had to be deeply hidden. This was not the situation in the
                East, and thus there is much more material, even if it is, in many instances, heavily disguised.</span>

          <div class="calibre25">
            <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">3. <span class="italic">Outer Alchemy.</span> This is
                more along the lines of Grey Magick. It uses sexual fluids, which have been magickally charged for the
                purpose of achieving a magickal goal. Note that this uses tangible elements as opposed to the sexual
                energies that are the basis of Inner Alchemy. Outer Alchemy is frequently associated with Western
                Hermetic alchemy, as much Western alchemical literature, once you know the code, is simply disguised
                instructions for sex magick.</span></blockquote>

    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">None of these three systems is easy to learn or master. Further, one
        hundred years ago the techniques were deep secrets and only spoken of in hushed whispers. But we are in a new
        era, and with the knowledge that may now be shared, along with sincere and dedicated practice, anyone may become
        proficient at any of the techniques of sex magick.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Many magicians believe that sex magick entirely traces its heritage
        back to the Tantrics of India and Tibet. While Tantra has influenced much of modern sex magick, there are
        aspects of sex magick that are from traditional Western sources, even if they do have similarities with Eastern
        practices. An example of this is that sex, and concomitantly sex magick, is a basic part of the Kabalah.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Even stodgy A. E. Waite (with blushing face, no doubt) admits in <span
          class="italic">The Holy Kabalah</span> that “the Supreme Wisdom [of the Kabalah] is a Mystery of Sex.” He also
        reports that the <span class="italic">Zohar</span> makes clear that the best time for a man and woman to have
        intercourse is on the holiest day of the week, the Sabbath. It is also stated there that if a man travels away
        from his wife for a time in order to study the Kabalah, on his return home his first duty and obligation is to
        make love to his wife.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Of course, there is a difference between sex and sex magick. But by
        understanding that the sides of the Tree of Life are masculine and feminine, and even the Tetragrammaton is
        composed of masculine and feminine letters, one can see the inherent sexuality of the Kabalah.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There is a Hebrew book called the <span class="italic">Iggeret
          ha-Kodesh</span> , which translates as <span class="italic">The Holy Letter</span>. This book dates from
        around the end of the thirteenth century, and on the surface is a type of medieval Jewish “marriage
        manual.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Today’s marriage manuals are nothing more than sex books giving
        various positions for sexual intercourse and other sexual activity. In ancient China these were known as “pillow
        books.” But marriage manuals were not always such. A century ago, many marriage manuals hardly even mentioned
        sex, limiting discussions to philosophy and simple psychology. This was primarily due to the cultures wherein
        these books were written and to the censorship rules of that society.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Judaism and Kabalists did not cringe from sexuality as did many
        cultures. One of the holy books of the Jews, found in the <span class="italic">Tanach</span>, is the <span
          class="italic">Sheer Ha-Sheer-eem</span> or <span class="italic">Song of Songs</span> (often called the <span
          class="italic">Song of Solomon</span>). On the surface it is nothing more than an erotic love poem. Yet, Rabbi
        Akibah, a famous mystic (one of his disciples, Simeon Ben Yochai, is said to have written the <span
          class="italic">Zohar</span>) said of this work, “The whole universe is not worth the day that book [<span
          class="italic">The Song of Songs</span>] has been given to Israel.” Further, he said that “all the scriptures
        are holy, but the <span class="italic">Song of Songs</span> is the most holy.” Certainly there is more to the
        sex of the <span class="italic">Song of Songs</span> than mere eroticism!</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">The Holy Letter</span> discusses sexuality in all
        of its aspects. This includes mystical and magickal aspects of sex. Thus we read, “when a man unites with his
        wife in holiness, the Shechinah is between them in the mystery of man and woman.” Since the Shechinah
        (pronounced “sheh-chen-ah,” “ch” as in the German “ach”) is equivalent to the idea of God’s Holy Spirit or the
        Tantric “Shakti” (note the similarity in the sounds of the words), we can see that the author of this book is
        talking about something special. Indeed, the author is discussing what is commonly called kundalini yoga (more
        accurately <span class="italic">Laya Yoga</span>). This will be discussed more when I talk about Inner
        Alchemy.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">The Holy Letter</span> also describes the aspect
        of sex magick that I term Thought Control. This type of sex magick may be the most palatable for people from
        Western cultures. <span class="italic">The Holy Letter</span> simply states, “According to the thoughts you have
        in intercourse, so will the form come upon the seed.” Superficially, this means that if you are thinking
        spiritual thoughts when having intercourse you will have a spiritual child; if happy thoughts, a happy child,
        etc. As we all know, however, every act of sexual intercourse does not result in the birth of a child. <span
          class="italic">Or does it?</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Certainly I could not deny that the number of times sexual intercourse
        leads to the birth of an infant human is small compared to the number of times sexual intercourse is performed.
        But think back to my comments on creative visualization. Remember that whether you realize the fact or not, you
        are constantly going through the visualization process. Likewise, every time you have sexual intercourse you
        give birth to what Crowley called a “magickal childe,” even if no human child is the result. Or, to put it
        another way, the key idea behind the Thought Control form of sex magick is that <span class="italic">the thought
          held at the instant of orgasm comes to pass</span>. Unfortunately, this is not as easy as it might sound. To
        understand why this is so we need to look at the theories of Dr. Wilhelm Reich.</span></div>
  </div>

  <div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-6">
    <h2 class="calibre29"><span class="calibre30">
        <span class="bold1">Reich, Energy, and Sex</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Many professionals in the field of psychology dismiss Reich’s concepts
        of Orgone and his ideas about the orgasm. They claim that one of Reich’s basic theories, that people who were
        psychologically disturbed could not have an orgasm, is false. It is clear that many people with
        psychopathological problems are capable of having an orgasm such as in the instance of violent rape. And, since
        this is a basis of many of Reich’s theories on orgasm and Orgone, he must be wrong.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Well, it is obvious to me that none of these “experts” on Reich ever
        bothered to read Reich’s works or else they are purposely misrepresenting it in order to further their own
        agendas. Reich <span class="italic">never</span> claimed that people with psychological problems were incapable
        of having an orgasm. Reich knew that such a person could have an orgasm. He must have been aware of the
        important psychological text <span class="italic">Psychopathia Sexualis</span> by Krafft-Ebbing. He was an M.D.,
        and that book had been the physicians’ resource on sociopathic sexuality for many years. What Reich said was
        that a person who was psychologically disturbed could not have a “potent orgasm.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Reich believed that during sexual excitation an energy, which he
        called Orgone, built up in the body. For full mental health this energy needed to be discharged during orgasm.
        You could compare this to blowing up a balloon. As the sexual excitation increases, more air is blown into the
        balloon. If you lose control over your consciousness, the air will be safely discharged through the valve on the
        balloon. If you do not lose mental control, the balloon increases in size and pressure until it explodes.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Similarly, the natural and healthy in-and-out flow of Orgone energy
        does not occur, according to Reich, in a person with a psychological disturbance. This type of person would have
        an unhealthy emotional, psychological, and/or physical control of him or herself at the moment of orgasm. They
        can’t let go.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This controlled behavior at the moment of orgasm, according to Reich,
        is not healthy. To be healthy, a person needs to be orgasmically potent. This means that during the convulsions
        of the orgasmic experience a person should not be thinking, “Am I doing this right? Is my partner enjoying
        this?” Rather, a person should be so caught up in the very animalistic enjoyment of sex that nothing can be
        thought of. There should be only pure, thought-free experience.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Does this idea of “thought-free experience” sound familiar to you? It
        should, because going into such a state is exactly what true meditation is! Reich discovered that the moment of
        orgasm can be identical to true meditation.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Reich believed that being orgasmically potent, being able to achieve
        the thought-free, sense-oriented state described above, was the only way to release Orgone energy. If this was
        not done, the human “balloon” would explode from over-inflation of Orgone energy. This explosion would be in the
        form of psychological or even physiological problems. While it is true that this is <span
          class="italic">one</span> way to release the Orgone energy, I must disagree with it being the <span
          class="italic">only</span> way. Tantrics have methods of controlling this energy at will. This will be covered
        in the section on Inner Alchemy.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Further, it is not true that a person experiencing an orgasm that is
        orgasmically potent is without thought. In fact, such a person is only without <span
          class="italic">conscious</span> thought. The act of sexual intercourse (or other sexual activity wherein a
        person is brought to orgasm) can be so primal that it may mentally take us to a period before our rational
        consciousness ruled our selves. Thus, it is our unconscious that holds sway over us at the moment we experience
        an orgasmically potent orgasm.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As I’ve written previously, the unconscious is our link to the astral
        plane (also called the Yetziratic World). When you create something in the astral plane as a result of your
        thinking procedures, it must come into existence on the physical plane. Whatever thought is in our mind at the
        point of orgasm goes directly to the unconscious and into the astral plane. It must manifest. That is why the
        thought held in the mind at the instant of orgasm must come into existence.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">But that is also the difficulty. To open up the unconscious we must be
        orgasmically potent. This means we must, temporarily, lose our sense of self, our ego. Unfortunately, that
        aspect of our being is locked up with our logical, reasoning self. If we lose that, how can we keep an idea in
        our mind when having an orgasm?</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Luckily, there is a way. The unconscious does not think in words, it
        thinks in symbols or images. You see the word “tree,” but the unconscious (and your memory) keeps an image of a
        tree you have seen or imagined at one time or another. Therefore, all you have to do is make up a symbol to
        represent what you want. Symbols, shapes, and objects can stay with you through an orgasmically potent orgasm
        while words will not. Simply keep the symbol in mind when you have an orgasm. And though this is not difficult,
        it does require practice.</span></div>

        <span class="bold1">A Sex Magick Ritual for a Couple</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Let both participants be aware that a magickal act, <span
          class="italic">a spiritual act</span>, is about to be performed, not just a common act of sexual intercourse
        resulting from romance, passion, or being “in love.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP ONE</span>. Let both participants know the
        purpose of this act. A divination should be done, with both persons present, to ensure the “karmic correctness”
        of the magickal act.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP TWO</span>. Let a suitable sigil,
        representing the purpose of the magickal act, be designed. Although a sigil taken from a grimoire will do,
        designing an original sigil is a better idea. The system of A. O. Spare is quite good for this.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP THREE</span>. Let multiple large versions of
        the sigil be made and placed around the room. This must include the ceiling so that no matter which way you look
        you will see the magickal sigil.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP FOUR</span>. A “Place of Comfort” should be
        established in the center of your area. Most commonly this is a small mattress or pad of some kind. If there is
        room, place your altar at the head of the Place of Comfort. If there is not enough room let the Place of Comfort
        be your altar.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP FIVE</span>. Both participants should take
        time now to shower and/or bathe. Do this separately. Use appropriate scents, perfumes, and oils on your body
        after you dry yourself. Oils are especially good for this, as different oils can be used on different parts of
        the body. Robe yourselves, realizing that you are about to perform a sacred, magickal act. As you come into your
        temple, remember that this is a holy place. Perform the Opening by Watchtower.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP SIX</span>. Now move to the Place of Comfort
        and begin to caress and adore one another. Slowly remove each other’s robes. If you wish, apply lubricating body
        oils to each other as you continue to caress each other freely. Explore each other totally with eye, ear, mouth,
        voice, hand, foot, tongue, etc. At this part of the ritual, think not of the rite. Rather, think of yourself and
        your partner. Let your sexual imagination run free.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP SEVEN</span>. When both people are ready,
        begin actual sexual intercourse. As you continue caressing, for a few moments there should be no thrusting
        motions on the part of either participant.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP EIGHT</span>. Begin very slow thrusting
        motions. As you both become more involved in this part of the rite, observe the sigils around you. <span
          class="italic">Do not concern yourself about their meaning.</span> Your unconscious already knows the meaning.
        Just look at the symbols.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP NINE</span>. Allow your passion to dictate
        the speed of your movements until the intercourse is quite rigorous. If you wish, change the position of your
        ritual lovemaking. That is why it is necessary to post copies of your sigil all over the room. No matter where
        you look, no matter what position you are in, you must be able to see a copy of the sigil. Place as much
        concentration as possible on the symbols. Continue to orgasm. If the couple has been together for a while and
        both know each other’s sexual responses, it would be best if both could orgasm at about the same time, although
        the so-called “mutual orgasm” is not necessary.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP TEN</span>. Stay coupled (maintain penile
        insertion) for as long as possible, to a maximum of fifteen minutes. During this time the ritualists may caress
        each other, but refrain from much speaking.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP ELEVEN</span>. Re-robe and perform the
        Closing by Watchtower.</span></div>

            be enough time allowed to build up the energy that is released with the symbolic thought at the moment of
            the active participant’s orgasm. A minimum of ten minutes is appropriate, but over half an hour is
            unnecessary. Certainly women will not have a problem with this, except possibly soreness due to prolonged
            intercourse with insufficient vaginal lubrication. This can happen to women who are not used to extended
            periods of intercourse, and can easily be remedied by the use of a <span class="italic">high quality</span>
            sexual lubricant.<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Men, on the other hand, might have one of two
                difficulties: staying erect with minimal physical sensation or having an orgasm too quickly. Masters and
                Johnson say that the average period for men between insertion of the penis and orgasm is about two and
                one-half minutes. Since this is an average, the implication is that some men will have an orgasm within
                seconds of insertion. Later in this lesson there are instructions on how a man may delay his
                orgasm.</span></div>

        the palms are toward your face. Seal the mouth by locking the lips between the little fingers and ring fingers
        of both hands. This holds the mouth shut. Seal the nose by pressing against the nostrils with the middle fingers
        of both hands. Seal the eyes by holding the eyelids closed with the pointer (index) fingers of each hand.
        Finally, use each thumb to seal the ears by closing the little flap of flesh in front of the ears, technically
        known as the tragus, over the entrance to the ear canals.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre12"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">The Yoni Mudra</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre13">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre12"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Pinky and ring fingers seal the mouth;</span>
        <br class="calibre5" /><span class="italic">middle fingers close the nostrils;</span>
        <br class="calibre5" /><span class="italic">index fingers gently hold eyelids to shut the eyes.</span>
        <br class="calibre5" /><span class="italic">Unseen: the thumbs seal the ears closed.</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This position closes most of the external senses and allows the inner
        senses to come through.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In a previous lesson I gave instructions on how to alter the state of
        consciousness. Methods include the use of alcohol to produce mild intoxication, lack of sleep, etc. In this rite
        the method used to increase the flow of blood to the head is to have the head below the rest of the body during
        intercourse.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If you have a mattress for the Place of Comfort, the seer may dangle
        his or her head over the side of the mattress. If the seer is in very good health, pillows may be placed so that
        the hips and legs are elevated. In fact, if oral sex is used, the position on the throne can actually be
        reversed so that the person’s legs are over the back of the chair and the person’s head is at the foot of the
        chair. The partner stands behind the throne and performs oral sex on the genitals, which are near the top of the
        chair’s back.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Important</span>: This should <span
          class="italic">not</span> be done if the seer has high blood pressure.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">When the seer has achieved orgasm, he or she should be questioned in a
        manner similar to the techniques in the previous lesson. If information about a particular subject is desired,
        during sexual stimulation the seer may look at a symbol that the partners created.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Before moving on, a final point about the Yoni Mudra. Students have
        told me that they have trouble breathing in this ritual pose. I really don’t understand how anyone could merely
        have difficulty breathing in this position because when you have the mudra locked in place, breathing shouldn’t
        be difficult, it should be <span class="italic">impossible!</span> Separate the middle fingers and slowly inhale
        through the nose. Replace the fingers and hold the Yoni Mudra and your breath for as long as it is comfortable.
        Then separate the ring fingers from the little fingers and exhale very slowly through the mouth. After the lungs
        are fully empty, replace the fingers and hold the mudra for as long as it is comfortable and repeat during the
        use of this position. When I explained this to students, some of them complained that it takes some of the
        spontaneity out of lovemaking. Remember that this is <span class="italic">not</span> lovemaking. It is highly
        ritualized and formalized. It is for a purpose; any pleasure that results is a wonderful bonus.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Another divination technique that uses sexuality is definitely not for
        all practitioners. Most will not wish to do it, and that is okay. It is called “Eroto-Comatose Lucidity” and
        does not involve a coupled pair. Rather, this ritual involves one ritualist-seer and several aides who are
        usually of the opposite sex. After the opening as above, the aides (and the more sexually experienced they are,
        the better) attempt to exhaust the ritualist sexually by every known means, and arouse the ritualist sexually by
        every known means. Every device and technique known may be used by the aides. If some of them tire, they should
        be replaced by others.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Finally the ritualist-seer will sink into a deep sleep as a result of
        utter exhaustion. Now the goal of the aides must be altered. They must try to awaken the ritualist through
        sexual stimulation alone. But, upon the first signs of the ritualist awakening, all stimulation must cease. This
        should continue indefinitely until the ritualist is in a state that is between waking and sleeping, “and in
        which his [or her] Spirit, set free by perfect exhaustion of the body, and yet prevented from entering the City
        of Sleep, communes with the Most High and Most Holy Lord God of its being, maker of heaven and earth.”</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The rite is over when the ritualist falls into total sleep, or
        awakens, has a final orgasm, and falls into an undisturbable sleep. Upon rising after this sleep, the
        ritualist-seer should immediately write down his or her remembrances.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This ritual of Eroto-Comatose Lucidity is from Crowley’s works,
        although it is said that the technique was devised by and given to him by one of his woman students. Another
        example of sex magick of this Thought Control type is novelized in Crowley’s book, <span
          class="italic">Moonchild</span>.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There is one more position for divinatory sex magick, which I will
        share with you. Let me make clear, however, that it is designed primarily for people who are slender, athletic,
        and strong. It involves a Tantric sexual position known as “The Crow.” After the usual opening and much sexual
        stimulation, the man, while standing, lifts the woman so that she is upside down and facing him. In this
        position they may have mutual oral sex. Usually, the woman will lock her legs behind the man’s neck or head,
        depending on the length of her legs. The man will usually support the woman by holding her around her waist.
        This position can cause the man to tire physically quite easily unless he is in very good shape and/or the woman
        is quite slender. The woman, who is completely inverted, will have a great deal of blood flow to her head. This
        can lead to seership and divinatory experiences.</span></div>

        <div class="calibre19">
          <div class="calibre16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Was Crowley Really Wrong?</span></span></div>
          <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
          <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">As I wrote, I consider it virtually sex abuse to use someone for
              sex magick and not let him or her know what you are doing. The question is, was Crowley really wrong when
              he suggested it?</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Well, on one level he certainly was. If you inform partners
              you’re going to do sex magick with them and they object, to go ahead and do it anyway is a form of abuse.
              By not telling your partner that you are doing sex magick you avoid this possibility but are being
              dishonest (through omission of information) and unethical.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">On another level, though, he may have had a point. If you say,
              “I want to do sex magick with you,” to a partner who is interested but untrained in magick, that person
              may agree, but then go on to ask things such as “Am I doing this right? Should I be doing something
              differently? Is the magick working? How should I help?” and so on.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">All of these questions are legitimate. All of them are
              reasonable. But they also have one thing in common: they’re going to take your attention away from the
              magick and direct it toward this person’s questions. It will have a similar effect to simply thinking that
              your ritual was not effective and won’t be successful.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">So, if you have a willing sexual partner and want to do sex
              magick without instructing him or her in the fine points of magick, what Crowley was saying really does
              make sense . . .</span></div>

        <span class="bold1">Outer Alchemy</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">The next technique I wish to talk about is called Outer Alchemy. Of
        the three techniques of sex magick, it is the easiest in that it requires the least amount of
        self-discipline.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Sex magick of Outer Alchemy, unlike the other two forms of sex magick,
        requires the use of a partner of the opposite sex. Thus it is by its very nature not a technique that can be
        adapted to male or female homosexual practices. This must lead us to a brief discussion of magick and
        sexuality.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Anybody can do the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram. It does
        not matter if you are Jewish, Christian, Moslem, Buddhist, atheist, or anything else. All that matters is your
        ability to perform the ritual.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">When I perform the ritual I may visualize God as a concept that exists
        before the gods and goddesses of creation. Others may see God as the Christian Trinity. Still others may view
        the source of the energy in the LBRP as Jah of the Rastafarians (or even the Flying Spaghetti Monster of the
        Pastafarians!). If it works for you it does not matter. The point I am trying to make is that although our
        magickal practices are spiritual, they need not follow any particular religious viewpoint. True, the Kabalah has
        an intrinsic Jewish flavor to it, but this is because it has been safeguarded by the Jews for the past few
        thousand years. One of the things I have tried to do in this course is make the procedures general in spiritual
        nature, and thus applicable to any religious belief (or lack thereof).</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Just as it is possible to separate spirituality from religion, so,
        too, from a sex magician’s point of view, it is possible to separate sex from love. Please note that I am not
        saying sex <span class="italic">should</span> be separated from love, only that it can be. But the fact of the
        matter is that for some people sex is not about love and romance. Rather, it is little more than a form of
        exercise with a pleasurable ending.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I am not taking the point of view that sex should be based only on
        desire, lust, enjoyment, etc. Sexual intimacy can be based on the relationship, which can develop between two
        loving people. In fact, the most valuable sex magick experiences I have had have been with partners whom I truly
        loved. But what I am saying is that just as spirituality can be separated from religion, so, too, can the sex of
        sex magick be separated from the sex experienced in a love relationship.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This does not mean that it’s okay to have sex with a person other than
        your regular partner using sex magick as an excuse for cheating. In fact, I would suggest that you do not do so
        unless you have told your partner about it and have your partner’s approval. And this approval should not come
        through gritted teeth and pursed lips due to anger and jealousy. Remember, honesty and integrity are vital to a
        magician.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This means that if you do not have a regular romantic partner or if
        you have your partner’s willing permission, it is allowable to work with another person or multiple persons when
        doing sex magick. Please note that what I am saying here is <span class="italic">not</span> meant to be a
        license to have sex with anybody because you are doing magick. Rather, I am saying that certain forms of
        magickal ritual, including sex magick rituals, can be done with a partner other than one you are involved with
        in a love relationship.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I personally consider love and established relationships to be very
        important in a person’s life. If your participation in a ritual, including a sex magick ritual, will create a
        hardship on your relationship, I urge you to reconsider your choice to perform such a ritual. Or, perhaps you
        can help your partner learn magick and have him or her participate in sex magick rituals with you.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">So if you happen to be a male or female homosexual, and both you and
        your partner believe that sex can be separated from love, you can perform Outer Alchemy. This will depend on
        your nature and the nature of your relationship. Perhaps the best way to conceive of a sex magick ritual is as
        just another ritual, one that happens to use genitals instead of a chalice or a wand.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It is the belief of many magicians that the classic texts of Western
        Alchemy are coded information for the performance of sex magick. The basic idea is that the sperm of the male
        and the ejaculatory fluids of the female have natural magickal qualities as a result of mental direction and
        sexual stimulation. The alchemical instructions are simply ways to make these magickal fluids stronger and more
        powerful.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Although I will be giving a type of Outer Alchemy ritual shortly, I
        will try to limit some of the precise alchemical terminology. Full alchemical practices, interpreted through the
        ideas of sex magick, are far too complicated to discuss in a course of this type.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">If you decide to investigate traditional alchemical texts as a source for sex magick
        rituals, it is important to understand two things:<div class="calibre24">
          <div class="calibre25">
            <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">1. Some of the practices given in the alchemical texts

          <div class="calibre25">
            <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">2. Several words commonly used in alchemy are codes for

          </div>

        <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Examples:</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The <span class="italic">Athanor</span> is usually described as a
        special type of oven used to slowly heat the material with which you are working. According to sex magicians it
        means the penis.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The <span class="italic">Serpent</span> is said to be a result of
        heating a substance in the Athanor. To a sex magician it is the semen.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The <span class="italic">Blood of the Red Lion</span> is also
        semen.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The <span class="italic">Curcurbite</span>, a type of alchemic
        container, is the vagina. So, too, is the <span class="italic">Retort</span>, which is usually described as
        another type of alchemical container.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The <span class="italic">Menstruum</span> or <span
          class="italic">Menstruum of the Gluten</span> is the result of the slow heating of a substance in the Athanor.
        Sex magicians believe it to be either the female lubricating fluids or ejaculatory fluids or both, depending
        upon the sex magician you talk with.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The <span class="italic">First Matter</span> is described as a mixture
        of the Serpent and the Menstruum. While this is a rather hazy type of substance to the physical alchemist, its
        meaning is clear to the sex magician.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Finally the <span class="italic">Amrita</span> or <span
          class="italic">Elixir</span> is defined as “the transmuted First Matter.” How it is transmuted and how it is
        used is the secret of Outer Alchemy.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">One of the traditional secrets of alchemy is that the process of
        taking your basic material and heating it must be very slow and take days or even weeks to accomplish. To a sex
        magician, this means that the best way to work with the male and female fluids is to take a great deal of time
        in their preparation, possibly hours. This involves having sexual intercourse without orgasm or ejaculation for
        a very long period. The mental technique used to accomplish this is known as <span class="italic">Karezza</span>
        (pronounced “kahr-etz-ah” with the accent on the second syllable).</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In previous editions of <span class="italic">Modern Magick</span> I
        traced Karezza back to a man named William Lloyd. He was a fascinating person who did write about Karezza, but
        only in 1931 and not the late 1800s as I incorrectly stated. In actuality, the idea was created by a woman named
        Alice Bunker Stockham (1833-1912). She was the fifth woman made a doctor in the U.S.A. and got into trouble for
        promoting birth control. Her interest in birth control was not so much to stop births of children (she was
        against abortion), but to save lives. At that time, the primary cause of death among young women was giving
        birth.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">She ended up going to India and learned about the physical actions of
        Tantra. She brought back the technique of prolonged intercourse without orgasm as a means of birth control. Side
        effects included improved relationships. Her book, titled <span class="italic">Karezza</span>, was published in
        1896.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Metaphysical thought in many places at this time believed that every
        drop of semen was equal to ten or more drops of blood. Therefore, having fewer ejaculations would be better for
        the man, while the increased intimate contact would be good for the couple and their relationship.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The problem with this, as already stated, is that according to Masters
        and Johnson, the average length of time for intercourse, from the time of the insertion of the penis to the
        man’s ejaculation, is two and one-half minutes. Since this is an <span class="italic">average</span>, it means
        that for every man who can last a mere five minutes without having an orgasm, there is another man who can last
        barely thirty seconds. Fortunately, there are a variety of techniques available to allow a man to delay his
        orgasm up to several hours.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The basic Karezza technique for delay of orgasm is to concentrate on
        the purpose or goal of the intercourse rather than on the physical sensations. In what we are doing here it
        would mean focusing on the purpose of the magick rather than obtaining sexual gratification, i.e., orgasm. If
        the man or woman comes too close to an orgasm, he or she should stop the physical motions, and if necessary the
        man should withdraw his penis from the vagina.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Unfortunately, this primarily mental technique of ejaculation control
        is not enough for many men who, from adolescence, have trained themselves to have ejaculation as a goal of their
        sexual activities. Many men believe the lie that they can have physical problems if they do not ejaculate every
        time they are involved in lovemaking. One woman told me that her boyfriend always insisted that he have an
        orgasm with her or he would get sick. And while it is true that after many periods of sexual excitation without
        an orgasm a man may feel some minor discomfort, colloquially known as “blue balls,” this is not a dangerous
        condition and is alleviated by having an orgasm or by the mere passage of time.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The point I wish to make here is that most men will need a combination
        of mental and physical techniques to be able to control their orgasm. This is especially true considering that
        some men, such as the boyfriend of the woman just mentioned, believe that orgasm must be their immediate goal in
        every sexual experience.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Of the physical methods, the most well-known technique, and the one
        that causes the most problems while you need to practice it, is the Masters and Johnson “squeeze” technique. In
        this technique, when the man feels that he is about to have an orgasm, but has not yet passed what is called the
        point of ejaculatory inevitability (when he can’t stop the ejaculation), he must withdraw his penis from the
        vagina. Then, either he or his partner must literally grab the penis and apply heavy pressure on the bottom of
        the penis, just behind the head of the penis until the need for ejaculation passes. After a few weeks of such
        practice the man can develop good control over his orgasm.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Unfortunately, this is not the most pleasant experience for the man or
        his partner! Certainly the partner would need to be very understanding while the man trains himself with her
        help. The following Tantric system is much better.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The advantage of the Tantric technique is that it uses several
        physical techniques simultaneously, and your partner need never know you are doing them. First, just before you
        reach the point of ejaculatory inevitability take a very deep breath and hold it for a slow count of sixteen.
        While you are doing this, look, with both eyes, at the tip of your nose.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Second, begin to breathe slowly. As you do so, roll your eyes in a
        counter-clockwise motion. First up as high as they will go, then straight to the left, then down, then to the
        right, then up, and finally back to where your eyes started. Thus, you are not making a circle, but a large
        square or rectangle. As you do this, tense the anus muscle (the sphincter) as hard as you can. Once you have
        completed the counterclockwise motion three times, release the anus muscle as you slowly exhale.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Repeat the above steps three times, even if the feelings of
        ejaculatory need have faded. Note that it is totally possible to use this technique without withdrawing from the
        vagina, and your partner need never know what you are doing.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">But the technique that is probably the best for control of orgasm is a
        Taoist technique and is primarily physical in nature. At the point just before ejaculatory inevitability, stop
        the thrusting motions and take three deep breaths. Then, using the first two or three fingers of either hand,
        apply firm pressure on the perineum, the point midway between the testicles and the anus. This point, known in
        acupuncture as Conception Vessel One, is important to the energy flow of the body’s reproductive system.
        Applying firm pressure here changes the energy pattern, which has a resultant effect on the physical organs.
        This actually causes a change in the valves within the reproductive system of the male with a suction-like
        effect. Ejaculation cannot occur.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Using one or another of these techniques you should be able to control
        your orgasm. The Taoist technique has an unusual side benefit, which I cannot go into too deeply here for this
        technique controls ejaculation only. Practicing with this technique until you learn how to exert mental pressure
        on the Vessel of Conception Point One will yield a change in the body’s energies so that the man can have an
        orgasm without an ejaculation. Since the result of ejaculation is de-tumescence in the male, the result of this
        technique is not only prolonged intercourse, but also the almost legendary male multiple orgasm. The feeling is
        much like small orgasms without ejaculation followed by an incredibly huge orgasm when the male does allow
        ejaculation to occur. Your experimentation with this technique is invited.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Now let us assume that the man has the ability to control his orgasms.
        The next part to understand is the idea of the Amrita, or Elixir. As I said, it is the <span
          class="italic">transmuted</span> or changed First Matter, the First Matter being the combination of the sperm
        and female fluids. Shortly I will discuss how the transmutation is done, but first I will discuss what is done
        with the transmuted First Matter, the true magickal elixir.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The basic idea of this type of Outer Alchemy is that the combination
        of the sexual fluids of a man and a woman (the First Matter) is magickal in nature (becomes the Elixir). The
        Elixir must then be reabsorbed by the magicians performing this type of sex magick. The easiest way to do this
        is to simply allow the now flaccid penis to remain in the vagina for a period of fifteen minutes. According to
        some Tantric traditions, sperm loses its magickal powers after fifteen minutes, so a longer period is not
        needed. These fluids, to a minor extent, and/or the energies they contain will be absorbed through the thin
        tissues of the vagina and the head of the penis. However, not all of the fluids are absorbed in this
        manner.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre2"><img alt="194" src="images/000162.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">Although many people raised in Western cultures may find the following idea disagreeable, a
        large number of sex magicians have overcome this phobia and treat the Elixir as a magickal Eucharist. As a
        friend of mine likes to poetically say,<div class="calibre20">
          <blockquote class="calibre21">
            <div class="calibre19">
              <div class="calibre12"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">First ’e loves ’er,</span>
                  <br class="calibre5" /><span class="italic">then Elixir! [he licks her]</span></span></div>
            </div>
          </blockquote>
        </div>
        <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In other words, after his orgasm the man performs oral sex upon the
        woman, taking the combined fluids into his mouth. He may then keep the fluids under his tongue, allowing them to
        be absorbed, for the most efficacy. Alternatively he may kiss his partner and share the Elixir. Another
        possibility is to put the Elixir into a small cup of wine and share the Elixir. It is this idea of swallowing
        the sexual fluids that may turn some people off. However, over the past forty years there has been an increase
        in the popularity of oral sex, so this taboo is quickly being overcome. In some cases, just a small drop of the
        elixir is used as a way to “charge” the wine, just as a small amount of “starter” is used to create an entire
        loaf of sourdough bread.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It should also be noted here that this type of ritual can be done with
        others present when the cup of wine is used. The Elixir-charged wine may be passed among those present. In fact,
        in some groups another man or woman is chosen as the “cup bearer.” It is his or her duty to obtain the Elixir
        instead of the woman’s sexual partner.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Obviously, there are many possibilities for Outer Alchemy. The next
        question is duration of the magick. As a result of personal experience by myself and by students who have
        reported back to me, as well as through research in various books, it is my belief that that the intercourse of
        sex magick should last a minimum of forty-five minutes to be effective, and after about three hours, depending
        upon the magicians, a point of negative returns is reached. So, as they currently abbreviate on the Internet,
        YMMV: “Your mileage may vary.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The final point before giving a ritual is the procedure of
        transformation, which turns the First Matter into the Elixir. It is done simply by prolonging the act of
        intercourse while focusing on a particular goal rather than for mere physical gratification. This can be
        accomplished by means similar to those already discussed, i.e., by will power or concentration on sigils.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There is also a system that aligns sex magick practitioners with the
        forces of nature and strengthens the transmutation.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Women have a natural menstrual cycle of approximately twenty-eight
        days, matching the cycle of the Moon. According to occult science, on each one of the twenty-eight days, a woman
        will secrete a different fluid when she is sexually excited and/or has an orgasm. Therefore, a sex magick ritual
        can be performed on a specific day of the month for a particular purpose. By combining the spiritual forces of
        humans with the forces of nature, the Elixir becomes an unbelievably powerful magickal fluid.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">Here is a copy of a published list of the magickal abilities of the fluids of the
        twenty-eight days, starting with the new Moon <span class="italic">of the woman</span>. That is, beginning with
        the day after the end of her menstrual cycle (from a list by Sariel):<div class="calibre24">

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Notice that some items on the list are very broad topics. They can be
        affected by the magicians’ contemplation during the magickal rite. As an example, the magicians may choose to
        help or hinder a fugitive from a bully by doing an Outer Alchemical sex magick ritual on the twentieth day of
        the cycle. Of course, since this is a type of Grey Magick, a divination should be done before a ritual of this
        sort.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I must note here that there are many lists of the magickal qualities
        associated with each day of the lunar cycle. Sometimes each day is referred to as a “digit of the Moon.” If you

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In his book <span class="italic">The Tree of Life</span> by Israel

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As you can see, there is some overlap with the earlier type of sex
        magick described in this lesson. At the end of the “Mass” is described a technique of charging a talisman by
        simply applying some of the Elixir to it. This is a very powerful technique, as your experience will come to
        show.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">From what you know it should not be too difficult to create your own sex magick ritual.
        First do the Opening by Watchtower. Then do the actual sex magick. Follow with the Closing by Watchtower. If
        there are other people present, they may sit, holding hands, in a circle around the pair practicing the sex
        magick. In some groups they watch the proceedings, their own excitation enhancing that of the two magicians
        directly involved. Other groups have the people sitting with their backs toward the center of the circle so that
        the couple will have a modicum of privacy. Those sitting in the circle should concentrate on the purpose of the
        ritual. This can be very difficult, as watching two people have sex (even if it is sex magick) for a few hours
        can become very boring. Thus, learning to concentrate on a desired subject or goal becomes very important. Then,
        as stated before, the Elixir can be mixed with wine either by the male ritualist or a cup bearer. The
        wine-Amarita mixture can then be passed around the circle. The couple actually involved in the sex magick should
        be the last ones to drink so that they get the final drops of the magickal mixture. The pair can each take a
        small sip, passing the cup back and forth until the fluid is gone. Then, together, they should hold the cup
        upside down and say,<div class="calibre20">

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The two systems of sex magick described so far in this lesson are
        traditionally Western in nature, although there is ample evidence that both have been used by the ancient
        Tantrics and Taoists. Similarly, the third form or Inner Alchemy is more traditionally associated with Eastern
        systems, although it also has a firm foundation in the West.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">The reason the previous form of sex magick is called “Outer Alchemy”
        is because it works with the energy systems of the body and magickally charges substances that are outside of
        the body part of the time. Inner Alchemy keeps all of the forces within the body and uses the force of
        magickally directed sexual excitation to strengthen and empower the psychic energies of the body. This Inner
        Alchemy may be the easiest to work for a magician who has diligently practiced the rituals of this
        course.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Inner Alchemy, sometimes called “Tantra yoga” or “kundalini yoga,”
        involves the taking of the sexual excitation and energy and channeling it to purposes other than sexual
        gratification. When you are quite sexually aroused and stimulated, send the energy up from the groin toward the
        head. This is sort of a reversed version of the Middle Pillar Ritual.</span></div>

        underground and are now kept within various occult orders. Most books coming out now are not written by
        initiated Tantrics. They are either compilations (cut and paste jobs) of earlier works, or the author’s errors
        and fantasies. Remember, many of the early Tantric texts were written in code, a “twilight language” similar to
        the alchemical code described earlier in this lesson. If you don’t know the code, you can only guess at the true
        meaning of the words.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Kundalini yoga is the ancient technique of
          causing the energy to rise up the spine until you achieve enlightenment. <span
            class="bold">False!</span></span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">First, while the concept of kundalini is ancient and established, the
        expression “kundalini yoga” is a relatively new term, invented by Westerners. The ancient term was <span
          class="italic">Laya Yoga</span> (pronounced “Lie-oh-gah”) and was first described over a thousand years ago.
        The Tantric who described it also explained that it was only symbolic, and not to be taken as reality.
        Furthermore, do you know anyone who has achieved enlightenment as a result of kundalini yoga? In your readings
        do the authors tell of anyone who has achieved enlightenment as a result of kundalini yoga, or do they merely
        tell what is supposed to happen? Have the authors of those books experienced it themselves? The answer to all of
        these questions is “No.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">The kundalini serpent is coiled three and a half
          times at the spine’s base. <span class="bold">False!</span></span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">All forms of yoga, to be valid, are true sciences. If proven false
        they are discarded. Have you ever seen a snake coiled up in the entrails of a human body? Of course not. It’s
        not there. Again, this serpent is symbolic&mdash;it’s a metaphor&mdash;not actual.</span></div>

        <span class="bold1">Some Initiated Truth about Tantra</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Now that I have dismissed some of the lies about Tantra and Laya Yoga,
        let’s start rebuilding from the ground up.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There are a large variety of psychic power centers throughout the
        human body. They are not limited to the five, six, seven, or eight you usually hear about. As an example, there
        are several in the head and others in the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. This will become
        important later in this lesson. In the meantime, it is absolutely <span class="italic">unimportant</span> to
        worry about whether or not the heart chakra or the brow (third eye) chakra is “open.” What <span
          class="italic">is</span> important is to learn how to make the energy flow up from the base of the
        spine.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">What I am about to present to you is not some theory that you are
        meant to visualize, but scientific fact. It is repeatable and verifiable under laboratory conditions. If I did
        not have to explain it to you in this course, I would have you experiment first and discover for yourself what
        thousands of people know. Further, I do not say this as a result of reading, but rather as a result of my own
        experience as an initiated Tantric. Of course, there are certain things which I cannot divulge as a result of my
        initiation vows, but by making slight alterations as well as coming up with techniques based on secret methods,
        I will be able to give you more real information on Inner Alchemy than has ever been published in one
        place.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In order to learn about the energy you must first learn about the
        breath. According to the ancient Tantric manuscripts (which may be the oldest spiritual writings in India), a
        breath lasts about 4 seconds. This means that in a day you breathe 21,600 times. (Calculate: 15 breaths per
        minute times 60 [number of minutes in an hour] times 24 [number of hours in a day] equals 21,600.) Of course,
        when sleeping or resting you breathe slower, and when exerting yourself you breathe faster. Therefore, this
        number cannot be taken as a real or even average figure. Rather, it is symbolic. And since these ancient
        Tantrics thought enough about the breath to figure out how many times we supposedly breathe in a day, it is
        logical to assume that the breath was very important to them.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">And, in fact, it is. The oldest and original mantra, the repetitious
        chant, is not that of “OM,” but is the sound of the breath.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Put down this lesson and just listen to the sound of your breath for a
        few seconds. Can you hear the mantra you recite 21,600 times a day? When you inhale, can you hear the sound
        “Hahm”? And on the exhale can you hear your breath say “Sah”? This mantra, Hahm-sah, is repeated unconsciously
        21,600 times per day. By controlling it we can learn to control its power.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">“Hahm-sah” is a Sanskrit word, which means “swan.” It is important to
        understand that <span class="italic">you do not say or chant this mantra</span>. Instead you simply breathe and
        hear it on your breath. Try it for a few minutes. (Note: Buddhists tend to reverse this with the mantra
        “so-aham.”)</span></div>

    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Once you can do this comfortably, instead of holding your breath on
        the inhalation, just pause for a second. Then use your stomach to help give you several short exhalations. This
        is accomplished by repeatedly jerking in or tensing the stomach muscles. You should hear your mantra saying,
        “Sah, Sah, Sah, Sah,” etc. Repeat until you are out of breath and need to inhale. When this happens, again take
        a long, slow, deep, breath, hold for a second, then repeat the “Sah, Sah, Sah, Sah” exhalation pattern. Keep up
        the visualizations, as above. Repeat the process for up to twenty minutes.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The first time I did this exercise I had phenomenal results. After
        about five minutes my body started to jerk about for no apparent reason. It was as if I suddenly got “the
        chills” or the “heebee jeebees” in a small part of my body, and that part just had to shiver or jerk about. This
        shivering and shaking is called <span class="italic">Shaktipat</span> and is a common part of the process. Then,
        the shaking suddenly stopped and my body seemed to change. I felt as if my body was taking the shape of a long
        tube and the sides of my head began to spread out. My body began to sway and my head turned jerkily and
        irregularly from side to side. At first I got the feeling that I was doing this to see to all sides as a form of
        protection. But then I realized that what had happened was that I had allowed the kundalini serpent, the <span
          class="italic">true</span> kundalini serpent, to become one with me. My body had spiritually assumed the shape
        of a serpent and my head had opened into a serpent’s hood. I was that snake.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Then, suddenly, I buckled over, almost in pain, from the most
        intensely erotic feelings I have ever experienced. Needless to say, it took quite some time for my breathing to
        return to normal!</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">All of these experiences can happen to you. The only real danger is
        that you may not expect the sensations you receive. Normally, a teacher would not tell you what could happen and
        would allow you to experience it and then “rescue you” from these unknown experiences. Since I cannot be with
        you, I am telling you what you may feel and what type of experiences you should expect. You may not feel the
        sensation of becoming one with the kundalini serpent or the intense erotic feelings with your first few tries at
        this Hahm-sah exercise, but you should eventually feel Shaktipat, the jerky motions. If you do not experience
        them, re-read the instructions for this exercise. Nothing is left out.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Once you have experienced Shaktipat within yourself, it is important
        to learn how to experience both Shaktipat and the movement of the kundalini energy in another person. To do this
        you need a willing partner. Your partner should preferably already have experienced Shaktipat within himself or
        herself.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The best position for this exercise is sitting on the floor or on
        pillows, or possibly on low stools of equal heights. You and your partner should sit, back-to-back, preferably
        naked, with your backs touching along their lengths. If you prefer not to have nudity, the wearing of thin
        cotton shirts is fine. Both of you should perform the Relaxation Ritual, then begin the Hamh-sah exercise. You
        should both breathe at the same time. Feel your energy and your partner’s energy go up and down the spine.
        Although the energy does flow within the spine (it is the spiritual essence of the cerebrospinal fluid), it also
        emanates beyond the physical body. The result of this exercise should be that both of your experiences should be
        intensified.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It is important to realize that all of the forms of working with the
        breath and working with mantras are <span class="italic">nothing but substitutes for sexual activity</span>. The
        reason they have been presented here is to simply and safely familiarize you with the feelings and sensations
        associated with the energies you have stimulated and are working with. The next step is to repeat the last
        exercise by using sexual activity as a prod for Shaktipat.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">To do this, once again sit back-to-back. In the previous exercise it
        would have been best if you both were naked. In this exercise it is a necessity. Here the breath no longer holds
        the same import as you move to tactile stimulation leading to the energetic sensations. After doing the
        Relaxation Ritual, both you and your partner should begin sexual self-stimulation. I hesitate to use the term
        “masturbate” as to many people this implies only penile or clitoral and vaginal stimulation. Rather, begin by
        caressing yourself. Feel your face, hair, and ears. Touch your hands, arms, chest, and breasts. Caress your
        feet, legs, and thighs. Learn to sexually stimulate your entire body. However, do not touch your partner except
        with your back.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Once you are both aroused, both of you should begin intense genital
        stimulation. This means not only stimulating the penis and clitoris, but also, if you like it, your scrotum,
        perineum, and anus or inner and outer labia, vagina (and G spot), perineum and anus. In fact, you can stimulate
        any part of your body that gives you the greatest excitation. However, neither of you should reach
        orgasm.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Stop the genital stimulation before orgasm is inevitable, but continue
        to stimulate other parts of your body. When the feeling of the immediate need for orgasm fades, return to
        genital stimulation. Continue this process until you experience Shaktipat and can sense the motion of energy in
        your partner.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Once you have done this you may either have an orgasm via
        self-stimulation, make love with your partner, or choose not to have an orgasm.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The next step is to vastly increase the flow of energy. This requires
        the uniting of the energies of both partners in a special way. It is a physical technique, which automatically
        increases the energy flows. For this first technique, both the man and woman should at least be wearing
        undergarments. Although more clothes may be worn, the genitals of both members of the couple and the breasts of
        the woman should have some covering. Swimsuits or tights and leotards also work well.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The man sits cross-legged on the floor, on a pillow, or on a very low
        stool or bench. The woman should sit on his lap, facing him, so that they can look at each other. She should
        wrap her legs around him. Pillows may be arranged to make this position easier to maintain for a period of time.
        If it becomes difficult, the man may extend his legs. Support for the back may be achieved by sitting next to a
        wall, a sturdy chair or sofa, or through the use of a special chair for sitting on the floor, commonly known as
        a “backjack.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Once you have both become comfortable in this position, it is the time
        for small talk. Ask if your partner is comfortable, is there anything your partner wants to say, are there any
        feelings or emotions that you or your partner wish to let go. Tell each other your fears and dreams, hopes and
        disappointments, successes and failures. This will help you develop deep rapport, uniting mentally and
        emotionally with each other.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Next, start adjusting your breathing patterns. The closeness of the
        position will make it easy for each of you to breathe <span class="italic">at opposite times</span>. When the
        woman breathes out, the man breathes in. When the man breathes out, the woman breathes in. It should only take a
        few moments for both of you to become comfortable with the mutual breathing pattern. If you have a break in the
        pattern, don’t worry about it, just relax and start again.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As a result of your practice performing the Middle Pillar Ritual and
        working with the mantra Hahm-sah as outlined earlier, you will have very strong effects as you go through the
        next part of this exercise. However, even if you have not done so, the physical actions will have an effect on
        you.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The man should look into the <span class="italic">woman’s right
          eye</span> and the woman should look into the <span class="italic">man’s left eye</span>. As she exhales and
        he inhales, she should sense the energy rising up her spine and leaving through her right eye, while he should
        feel the energy coming out of her right eye, in through his left eye and down his spine.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">As the man exhales and the woman inhales, he should feel the energy continue down his spine
        and out through his penis. She should feel the energy coming out of his penis, into her vagina and up her spine.
        This is represented diagrammatically in the figure below:<div class="calibre2"><img alt="195"
            src="images/000198.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>
        <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Before moving on to the next technique, you must be able to maintain
        this posture for a minimum of twenty minutes, although forty minutes is preferable. If it is too difficult to
        remain in this posture, there is another easier alternate, which will also work well. The major difference is
        that both partners simply stretch out their legs. He can lean back and use his arms to support himself or may
        even lean up against a wall or some pillows if there is room for his partner’s legs. She may choose to leave her
        legs out or wrap them around her partner below her.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Feel the motion of the energy and how it builds to a level even higher
        than you have achieved alone or back-to-back. As you practice you may find yourselves shaking from Shaktipat.
        That is a good sign. However, because of the closeness due to the linked breathing and the circulation of energy
        between both of you, intense sexual excitation and desire may occur. While this, too, is a good sign, wait until
        you have finished the exercise (twenty to forty minutes) before engaging in intercourse or other sexual
        activity. You may find it to be some of the most ecstatic lovemaking you have ever experienced.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The next step is to repeat the above exercise while unclothed. At this
        time the penis should not be in the vagina. As the experience of Shaktipat intensifies with this technique, you
        may be tempted to fiercely hug and caress one another. Resist this temptation! Keep clear and open eye contact
        with each other. You will quickly learn that the energy field is broken&mdash;or at least reduced&mdash;when eye
        contact is broken. The result is a loss of built-up energy, and it may take many minutes to rebuild the energy
        level that existed before the break in eye contact.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">After you have practiced this technique without clothes to a point
        where you can maintain the eye and breath contact for a minimum of twenty minutes, you may add physical
        caresses. Since you do not want to break eye contact, this cannot include kissing and will be limited to the use
        of the hands. Pay special attention to the parts of the body that are not generally considered highly sensitive
        to touch. Caress the face and ears (don’t block the eye contact), the arms, legs, chest, and stomach. The woman
        can reach under herself to caress his penis and scrotum while he can also caress her breasts, clitoris, and
        labia. Although neither of you should have an orgasm, it will be a good sign if her lubricating fluids make both
        of your genitals quite wet. If either of you feels an approaching orgasm, you should tell your partner so he or
        she will change the method of stimulation. Continue this practice until it can be done for a minimum of twenty
        minutes, although lasting forty minutes would be better.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">When the caressing is added, the amount of energy cycled between you
        should again increase to a higher level. The Shaktipat quivers and jerks may be enough to shake you apart from
        one another, in which case you should start the exercise over. Once you have completed this exercise,
        intercourse or other sexual activity may take place if desired.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As you have read, and I hope have experienced, the more intimate the
        contact, the greater the amount of psycho-sexual energy. The greater the amount of intimate contact, the more
        powerful are the Shaktipat jerks and shakes. Also, they are greater in number. The intensity of the energy
        increases.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If you have accomplished all of the above exercises to your
        satisfaction, you are ready to proceed to the next ritual. All that I have described in this section has only
        been preparation for the next rite.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP ONE</span>. Have your room dimly lit,

        should be some water, wine, cooked or dried meat or dry cereal, fish or ginger, and sensual “toys” such as

        candles. As you wash each other, talk out any problems you had during the day and let the emotional charge
        associated with these problems fade away. As the problems and their associated emotions fade, feel free to play
        with one another. Although sexual contact is encouraged, do not have intercourse. If you do not have access to a
        bath, shower together, then apply a light amount of scented oil or talc to each other. Finally, put on your
        magickal robes and enter your magickal temple.</span></div>

        Caress each other both physically and with words until the sexual excitation becomes so intense that the robes
        must be removed. Do so. Although you shouldn’t have any clocks showing in the room, if it seems like this step
        took less than what you figure to be half an hour, <span class="italic">slow down!</span> You are going too

        such a state that the man is very erect and the woman is very lubricated, they can assume either position
        already given in the exercises. However, this time the woman should take the penis and insert it into her
        vagina.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There is another position, which many couples seem to prefer, and this
        can be used as an alternative to the previously described positions. The man lies flat on his back and brings
        his legs up so that they almost touch his chest. The woman, with her back toward his face, literally sits on his
        exposed penis, making sure that she achieves a deep penetration into her vagina. At this time the man can relax
        his legs. If the woman pivots to either side slightly, he will find that he will be able to place one foot on
        the floor and rest the other leg over her hip and leg.</span></div>

        you will find that by now you should have reached a stage where eye contact is no longer necessary. But you must
        keep up the linked breathing pattern. And, most importantly, don’t move! That is, there should be no thrusting
        motions by either the man or woman. The only motions should involve the woman contracting and relaxing the
        muscles of her vagina and the man flexing the pubic muscles so that the penis will move within the vagina

        experience. “Maha” means “great,” and the MahaTantra experience is great indeed! It is nothing less than the
        experience of Shaktipat magnified a millionfold.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">For most people, orgasms tend to be a brief climax, which only
        resolves the immediate buildup of sexual energy. Only rarely is it a true, total release. The MahaTantra
        experience is that ultimate, desired super-orgasm wherein your entire body seems to release the pent-up tension
        of years. Generally it lasts for only twenty seconds to two minutes, but it may seem like it lasts for hours.
        During it you may experience feelings of joy, power, release, excitement, contentment, unity with all; of being
        one with the Divine Source of All That Is. It is enlightenment. It is an altered state of consciousness that
        makes LSD, mescaline, ayahuasca, <span class="italic">Salvia Divinorum</span>, and other <span
          class="italic">entheogens</span> (from the Greek, literally “becoming divine within”), psychoactive substances
        used for religious or spiritual purposes, seem like a grain of sand compared to an indescribable desert of
        ecstatic experience.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">You may have an orgasm when you experience MahaTantra and if the man
        does so he may or may not have an ejaculation of sperm. And although this technique is a form of Inner Alchemy,
        as was suggested in the ritual, do not waste the Elixir.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Of the MahaTantra experience I can tell you no more. Not because of
        vows or anything like that, but because there are no real words to describe intensely personal and subjective
        experiences. Until you have experienced MahaTantra, no words can describe it. Once you have experienced
        MahaTantra, no words can express it.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This ritual can be used to create intense spiritual experiences that
        can last hours, days, or longer. It requires no special mental work or direction. It is the equivalent of what
        many people spend years in meditation in order to achieve. But don’t take my word for it. Do the work necessary
        to be able to do this ritual and try it for yourself. It is a high form of White Magick.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If desired, you could also focus on a magickal goal or use techniques
        similar to those described earlier in this lesson so your unconscious mind is filled with a symbol representing

    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Once again I would like to remind you that this course is only an
        introduction to ceremonial magick. Just as in the last lesson I could not give you all of the names and powers
        of the spirits you could evoke, so, too, in this lesson I cannot give you all of the forms and rituals of sex
        magick. In fact, the ideas and rituals have been rather schematic in nature. This is because I do not want you
        to be incapable of original magickal thought. True, the various banishings stay the same, but other parts of the
        rituals can be added to or subtracted from as you see fit. The only judge in this must be your success or
        failure.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">With your knowledge of the three types of sex magick, Inner and Outer
        Alchemy, and Thought Control, you should be able to pick up any book that covers sex magick and understand what
        is written there. I say “should” because most magicians who perform sex magick try to keep their secrets under
        the cover of coded or “twilight” language. Others hide it in archaic or obsolete wordings that make A. E. Waite
        seem clear and simple!</span></div>

          <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Sex magick is not about love and romance, it’s about magick. It
              uses arousal and the linking of sexual polar energies to create massive increases in magickal
              power.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Unfortunately, since the birth of the concept of “romantic love”
              in the late Middle Ages, sex and love have become linked in our minds. As a magician you might ask
              yourself if that link is true and genetic or simply societal. If you come to the conclusion that it is
              genetic, you will only want to do sex magick with your romantic partner. If you come to the conclusion
              that it is societal and can free yourself from the belief that sex and romantic love must be linked, you
              can partner with anyone who wishes to partner with you. I repeat, this is not about love, romance and
              attraction; it’s about magick. Some people will have difficulty dealing with this and that’s fine. You
              don’t have to deal with it. In fact, you can be a successful magician and never do sex magick at
              all.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Further, just as a straight person or a gay person can work with
              the tools of a magician, there is no reason why a person cannot do sex magick with members of the same sex
              (even if you’re straight) or opposite sex (even if you’re gay). This may shock both straight and gay
              people but remember&mdash;this just uses sexual activity to do the work. It’s not about love and romance
              and personal desire. I have to admit, however, that some people simply cannot respond to members of their
              own gender or the opposite gender. For these people <span class="italic">some</span> aspects of sex magick
              won’t work, but others will. I would respectfully focus on what you can do rather than what you can’t or
              won’t do. And remember, you don’t have to do sex magick at all.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If you notice, one of the things I mentioned was the concept of
              polar energies. Previously I have discussed the idea of our understanding of things by way of
              opposites&mdash;up and down, electric and magnetic, positive and negative, male and female. If you think
              about the information I’ve shared on the Tree of Life and the way it manifests within us, you can see that
              every person is capable of manifesting both the left and right pillars, the feminine and masculine pillars
              of severity and mercy.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This means that although I have used the classical terms of male
              and female, man and woman in describing the workings in this chapter, many of the exercises and techniques
              can easily be refocused toward people of the same sex. Use your imagination and work on the concept of
              balancing polarities of energy, not gender.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This chapter is about the way most people practice sex magick
              today. If you are interested in more information on Western sex magick, please see my <span

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It is claimed by some that the wandering minnesingers, golliards, and
        minstrels of the late Middle Ages practiced some form of sex magick. This was coded into their music. For
        example, the word “die” in those songs meant “to have an orgasm.” By understanding this, such lyrics as “I die,
        I die in sweetest agony” become clear in meaning. Later, this tradition was carried on in Victorian Age erotica
        wherein an orgasm was frequently described as “the little death.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Aleister Crowley, being no stranger to erotic literature, continued
        with the same allegorical idioms. In <span class="italic">Magick</span> he claimed to have made a sacrifice of
        “a male child of perfect innocence and high intelligence” 150 times a year between 1912 and 1928. Of course, he
        was not admitting to the murder of 2,400 children! Some Crowley commentators claim that this refers to magickal
        masturbation of the Outer Alchemy tradition. Others claim that he was “taking away” the virginity of another
        person. If this latter is true, I am inclined to believe that Crowley did more than a bit of leg-pulling
        concerning numbers!</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In a ritual printed in Crowley’s massive work <span class="italic">The
          Equinox</span>, there is an instruction for one of the participants in a ritual to take a sword “and slit his
        throat therewith.” This probably refers to magickal masturbation. In context, it occurs while watching another
        couple engaged in ritual sex magick.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There are a variety of positions for ritualized sexual intercourse,
        but since they are already printed in many sources, I will not repeat them here. I urge you to investigate them
        from the books listed in this lesson’s bibliography.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Let me repeat that the threefold division of the types of sex magick
        are quite arbitrary. I have used them merely as a way to make communication of the various techniques easier. In
        actual practice, those divisions tend to blur. That is why in the technique of Inner Alchemy, a useful result is
        the Outer Alchemy Elixir.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Some of you may have read that a man should not have an ejaculation at

        partially withhold sperm is a matter of choice. Certainly the withholding of the sperm negates some forms of

            the sperm, or through a special hatha yoga technique, which causes a suction within the bladder and allows

            old age, he may ejaculate only once every few months. This does not mean that he should in any other way
            limit his sexual pleasure. Those of you who are interested in Chinese and Taoist philosophy may wish to
            consider this attitude. (However, a 2008 study from the University of Nottingham shows that frequent
            ejaculations by men in their twenties and thirties increased the chance of prostate cancer, while frequent

            something that I have noticed and would like to draw to your attention. There was a period of time when men
            only considered their own sexual pleasure. More recently, men have become interested in the pleasure of
            their partners. With the onset of the modern women’s movement, many women have decided to become responsible
            for their own orgasms, even if they are with a partner. In a sense, this is like the period when men were
            only interested in themselves, although it is nowhere near as selfish. But more recently I have met several
            women who really enjoy sex and want their partners to prove that they are also enjoying sex. In other words,
            they want their male partner to have an orgasm and ejaculate. And if their partner doesn’t have an orgasm,
            they want to know why or what is wrong. Several women have also told me that even if they have one or more
            orgasms, they feel the act of sex is incomplete until their male partner has also had an orgasm.<div
              class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">While I make no claim to my researches being final or even
                scientific, I certainly believe that the day when Crowley said you can use any woman for sex magick, and
                not tell her what you are doing, is past. If your partner asks you why you did not have an orgasm, you
                had better be prepared to say why.</span></div>

        <span class="bold1">God Eating</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">There are many people who firmly believe “you are what you eat.” In
        some primitive tribes, the heart of a valiant enemy might be eaten to gain his courage. The hunter who slew an
        animal would have the first choice of what part of the animal to eat in order to absorb those qualities of the
        animal that he wished to possess.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The ultimate form of this belief comes with “god eating.” This was a
        pre-Christian tradition, which was eventually adopted by the Christians, and especially by Roman Catholicism.
        The idea is simple: bring the essence of a god or goddess into something edible and then allow the worshippers
        to eat that food and thus eat that god or goddess. The result of this would be that those who ate the deity
        would absorb the qualities of that deity.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I find another similar idea far more enticing. If the essence of a
        deity can be invoked into food or drink, why not invoke that god or goddess into a person and have sexual
        relations with that god or goddess? Certainly the myths of Greece and Rome are filled with such ideas. There are
        some Wiccans and witches who practice this, calling it the “Great Rite.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The technique is twofold. First, the appropriate god or goddess must
        be invoked into a man or a woman. For this see the instructions in Lesson Nine of this course. Second, the other
        person should first worship the embodied god/goddess and consider what he or she is about to do: make love with
        a god or goddess! The worshipper should take that attitude and demeanor and realize how privileged he or she is.
        The worshipper should really be in an almost constant state of awe! Any sexual fluids from the embodied
        god/goddess are holy and should be considered as a sacrament.</span></div>
    <h2 class="calibre29"><span class="calibre30">
        <span class="bold1">A Taoist Alchemical Sex Magick Ritual</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">The ancient Taoists had a ritual similar to Laya Yoga. It usually took
        place outside, on a hill, and required the person seeking enlightenment, a sensitive assistant, and usually one
        or more sexual helpers.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">First, through sexual activity and breath control the main participant
        would reach a state before orgasm and seek to maintain that state with the help of his or her sexual helper(s).
        The result of this, of course, would be the physical twitches the Tantrics call Shaktipat. The sensitive
        assistant would watch and detect the energy as it begins to move up the spine. To prevent the energy from
        leaving the body, the assistant would plug the anus with material dipped in wax.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The assistant would watch as the energy moved up the spine. If it
        seemed to stop, the assistant would pinch and poke the body to make the energy continue to rise. As it
        approached the head, the assistant would make sure that the head’s orifices, as with the anus, were plugged up
        at the right moment so that the energy could not escape. The result would be that the energy would end up
        “exploding” out the top of the head, through what the Tantrics called the “lotus of 1000 petals,” and the final
        outcome would be Nirvana, or Enlightenment.</span></div>

        </span></span></h1>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">When I first wrote <span class="italic">Modern Magick</span> the U.S.
        culture was moving into what was called the “Me Generation.” I wrote that in my observations of culture over the
        years I had noticed a strong change in society. Back when I was first learning magick and before the Me
        Generation, it seemed like most people cared more about one another and the environment than they did when <span
          class="italic">Modern Magick</span> was originally published. Granted, this was a generalization, but I found
        through interactions with correspondents and students that although people were talking about community and
        ecology, their main interests seemed to be how much money they could earn and where the party was that they’re
        going to attend that night. From a magickal standpoint those selfish attitudes were a necessary outcome and
        response to the previous cycle of caring about society and the world. I certainly do not, therefore, condemn
        what I saw, though I was saddened. It seemed a “media event” had to be scheduled before anyone would show how
        much they claimed to care.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">No, I couldn’t condemn the people who had that attitude. If anything,
        I must condemn the members of the previous generation who were too directed toward society and could not see the
        underlying nature of the universe. Every action does have a reaction. In one cycle people try to change society,
        in another people try to improve their personal wealth. And so it goes . . .</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As I write these pages for the third edition of these lessons, things
        are changing once again, but this time out of necessity rather than choice. Economies of countries around the
        world are shaky and many people are losing their jobs. They have to depend upon their neighbors and loved ones.
        As a result, thoughts move from acquiring wealth to mere survival&mdash;survival of the individual, the family,
        the community, and the planet. The wheel continues to revolve. And so it goes . . .</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I have yet to meet any group that is perfect. But one group which I
        have always supported is the loosely knit women’s liberation movement, now more commonly known as the feminist
        movement. Certainly it had (what I consider to be necessary) excesses in the beginning. But one thing that was
        very important was their insistence that each woman should be viewed as a unique individual and not as an
        object. Unfortunately, sexism towards women has not decreased. It may be less overt, but it is still strongly in
        existence.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">To top this off, there is a new prevalence of sexism toward men. In
        the past I have heard men talk about their dates not in terms of a woman being interesting, intelligent, fun to
        be with, stimulating, erotic, etc. Rather, they talk about the size of her “boobs” or the shape of her legs.
        Recently I have heard more and more women, when discussing their dates with men, describe them not as fun,
        intelligent, gentle, kind, generous, stimulating, etc. Rather, they talk about how he was cute and had “tight
        buns” or “good pecs.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Far be it from me to criticize beauty. It is a marvelous gift from the
        Divine, although the Divine is often helped at the spa and by the plastic surgeon. Still, to judge a person only
        on their appearance is nothing less than vicious and cruel. It turns people who don’t match some imagined norm
        into sad, unfulfilled, and lonely people. And since most of appearance is a gift of birth, it is clearly but a
        step away from racism.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It is not only those who are oppressed who experience loss as a result
        of “appearance-ism.” Those who do the oppression suffer, too, for they never interact with others who may have
        an amazing amount of wisdom, knowledge, cleverness, and humor that is so bright it far outshines their physical
        appearance. In truth, the oppressed might be able to add to the life of the oppressor more than the oppressor
        could even imagine.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I freely admit that I like to be in the company of what I consider to
        be beautiful women. However, some of the most beautiful women I have ever met have not stepped out of a magazine
        centerfold. In fact, the women who have been my favorite (and most erotically exciting!) lovers have not fit the
        Miss America/Playboy/Penthouse mold. Those who have studied Crowley’s life know that he took exceedingly ugly
        women for lovers on purpose. But what does all this have to do with sex magick?</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Perhaps the most racist and sexist society that ever existed was in
        India during the Middle Ages. Everyone had strict rules to follow dependent upon parentage. This “caste” system
        existed for hundreds of years. If you were in an upper class you could be “defiled” by having the even the
        shadow of a member of the lowest class, an “untouchable,” pass over you. It was a racist, sexist society that
        makes ours look like pure equality by comparison. But there were freedom fighters then as now.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">During the day they obeyed all the rules. But at night, when the
        curtains were pulled, things were different. Rather than trying to change society, they tried to change
        themselves. Outside, they acted like anyone else. But in their temples, within the KalaKakra or “magick circle”
        these Kaula Tantrics treated everyone equally. Caste, appearance, skin color, or shade made no
        difference.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Inside the Tantric temples all men were gods and all women goddesses.
        And these Tantrics developed a whole philosophy of beauty, love, understanding, sensitivity, science, and art
        while western Europe went through the Dark Ages, a period of hate, filth, superstition, ignorance, prejudice,
        and selfish egotism. Naturally, when the Westerners conquered India with their better weapons, they tried to
        destroy Tantrism for being “evil.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">You may have heard of the KalaKakra and its group sex magick ritual.
        If you and some friends have been practicing the material in these lessons and wish to try the ritual I will
        present next, you may want to adopt the attitude of the Tantrics. It is very unlikely that all of you will
        appear to have stepped from the pages of <span class="italic">Playboy</span> or <span class="italic">GQ</span>.
        You must be able to see the beauty, the Divinity, the “likeness of God or Goddess” within us all. Due to society
        and the impact of film and television, it is doubtful that a group of ten men and women could do this.
        Therefore, I suggest starting with this preliminary exercise.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This exercise should be done with a minimum of three men and three
        women. Five or more of each sex would be preferable. In a large room let there be one of the women and all of
        the men. There should be a comfortable chair in the center wherein sits the woman. The men sit on cushions in a
        circle around the woman. Everyone should be naked. The other women should sit outside the circle in darkness and
        may or may not be dressed.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">By predetermination, let one person do the LBRP and another do the
        BRH. Similar rituals, although with a Hindu flavor, were done by the ancient Tantrics. Now, one at a time, let
        each man worship the woman in the center of the circle. For she, like all women, is the embodiment of the
        feminine aspect of the Divine. Each may worship her in his own way. You may dance or sing in her honor. You may
        wash her hands and feet or caress her. And yes, this does imply touching or kissing the breasts and genitals.
        However, it must be treated in the form of worship and awe, not mere sex. Other ways of worship would include
        chanting her name over and over, giving her gifts, giving her food, rubbing her with scented oils, etc. If she
        becomes sexually aroused, this must be seen as a sign of favor of the goddess that she is. Close with the
        LBRP.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Now, without saying anything, repeat the entire exercise with one of
        the men in the center and all of the women, now nude, in the circle. He should be worshipped as the male aspect
        of the Divine. The rest of the men may wait in the darkness outside the circle as the women did before. The man
        should not be the boyfriend, regular lover, mate, or husband of the woman who was previously in the middle of
        the circle.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Once this is completed, let everyone dress and then gather in a circle
        and discuss his or her feelings. Special attention should be paid to the feelings, expressions, and actions of
        both the people who were in the chair, acting the roles of the goddess and god, and their regular romantic
        partners (if any). Is there any jealousy or anger? Are such emotions hidden just below the surface? If so, these
        people either must work out their feelings or accept that currently they are not meant for this type of magickal
        work. The following week this ritual exercise should be repeated with a different man and woman. Eventually,
        this should be done with each of the women and men of the group.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The ancient Tantrics had nothing exactly like this, but they did have
        years of training under the watchful eye of the Tantric master teacher. Only when the teacher decided that a
        pupil was ready to participate in the KalaKakra ritual would that student be allowed to join. Since you probably
        do not have a Tantra master on your block, the above exercise will help weed out those who are not emotionally
        ready for the group working. This does not make them bad or immature. It merely means that at this time they are
        not psychologically and/or emotionally ready to perform this type of magickal work. If one member of a couple is
        not ready to participate, both should be excluded.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Let us assume that you have five men and five or more women ready to
        do the KalaKakra ritual. There may be more women as they are seen as initiatrixes and instructresses and can
        help the couples in the ritual. Have a room with no furniture but filled with pillows and throws. If it is
        winter, be sure that the room has plenty of heat. Let there be incense and candlelight and flowers, food, wine,
        and cool water. Let there also be erotic playthings such as scented oils, feathers, and soft, furry things. Let
        all the foods be in bite-size pieces. Let gentle music fill the air.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Let there be two other rooms, one a changing room for the women, and
        one for the men. Let each change into special outfits. For the men, big, loose peasant shirts and drawstringed
        or loose, elastic-wasted pants are excellent. Rings and necklaces are appropriate, as are small bells on the
        clothes and jewelry. The same is true for the women. Sheer or transparent clothes are also appropriate. Men and
        women can apply make-up and even exotic body paints to exaggerate their sexuality. An example of this might be
        adding some red color to the areolas around the nipples. Today, many men and women shave or trim their pubic
        hair and you may wish to do so. Also use small drops of different scented oils at various spots on the body so
        that a traveling nose can find different scents wherever it may wander. All of the women should wear soft shoes
        which are easily identifiable from each other.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Let the men go into the main room first and do the LBRP and BRH. Once
        this is done one man should take the knife used for the LBRP and touch its point to the floor just to the right
        of the door through which women will enter. He should then pick the blade straight up as high as he can reach
        and move it over the top of the door and down to the floor by the left of the door. He has thus “cut a doorway”
        in the magick circle to allow the women to enter. A knock on the door will be a signal for them to do so, and
        once they come into the circle, the actions of the man with the knife should be reversed so that the circle is
        closed.</span></div>

          <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
          <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">When <span class="italic">Modern Magick</span> was first
              published, it put forward lots of ideas and concepts that many people were talking about or doing, but
              about which nobody had written. As far as I know, it was the first major occult work to deal with AIDS. It
              was the first occult volume that looked for harmony between ceremonial magicians and Pagans. It was the
              first set of lessons to reveal the blinds in the grimoires. It was the first occult work that really did
              give a useable, progressive education in magick without being dogmatic. It was the first major occult
              volume to give specific and explicit instructions in sex magick. There were a lot of other minor firsts in
              the first edition of <span class="italic">Modern Magick</span>.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">And now, some people have been shocked not because I have
              insisted that something they didn’t like was necessary, but only that if you wish, you might want to trim
              or shave your pubic area. <span class="italic">“Oh. Mah. Gawd. Did he</span>
              <span><span class="underline"><span class="italic">really</span></span></span>
              <span class="italic">say that?”</span></span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Although it may surprise many people reading this, the shaving
              or trimming of pubic hair has a long history. The ancient Egyptians did it, as did the ancient Greek women
              (but not the men). The Roman women also did it, as did the British Celtic men (according to Julius
              Caesar). Both male and female Muslims did this and the returning Crusaders (eleventh to thirteenth
              centuries) brought the practice to Europe. Special shaving rooms were included in some castles, but the
              practice slowly died out. It started to regain popularity in the mid to late 1970s.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The modern popularity of women shaving legs and underarms only
              dates to 1915. It was due to an advertising campaign for razor blades, which implied that women’s underarm
              hair was not hygienic. In fact, it could be considered a tertiary sexual organ, as it holds pheromone
              scents secreted by glands under the arms. Unfortunately, this can also be a problem area, as the hair
              under the arms can also hold undesired bacterial odors.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The same is true with pubic hair. Some find pubic hair
              attractive while others find the trimmed or shaved look more revealing and sensuous. Increasingly, men are
              starting to shave their pubic area. There are even electric shavers made for men specifically for
              “manscaping.” One major razor manufacturer claims shaving the pubic area adds a “visual inch”&mdash;that
              is, it makes the penis appear longer&mdash;as part of its sales pitch.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If you choose to shave, trim, or use other forms of hair removal
              such as waxing, depilatories, etc., be very careful. Cuts and razor burn or allergic reactions can be very
              painful and distressful.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There is a myth among a small segment of feminists that women
              shouldn’t copy actresses in adult films who shave their pubic areas as it supposedly appeals to pedophilic
              desires in men. Considering many of the same women have surgeries to make their breasts
              larger&mdash;sometimes impossibly large&mdash;this doesn’t make sense. Prepubescent girls generally don’t
              have breasts the size of basketballs.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Actually, there is a very simple reason that women in adult
              movies (and men) shave or trim their pubic areas: it makes it easier for the camera to capture the
              intimate action. How do I know this? For several years I worked as a writer for an advertising agency that
              specialized in ads for adult entertainment. We often took photos of models and that’s the exact reason we
              asked models to be trim or hairless in the pubic area.</span></div>

      </blockquote>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The men should sit toward the rim of the circle. The women should walk
        or dance in a clockwise manner around the circle. They may laugh, talk, or sing&mdash;whatever they desire. The
        men may not use their hands in any way. The women may feed the men, kiss them, give them wine or water to drink,
        but the men may not use their hands. This usually leads to much laughter and frivolity, a pleasant gift of the
        gods of Tantra. The women should not stay too long with any one man.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This can last for as long as you like, although the smaller the number
        of participants, the shorter it will be. Usually there is a minimum of a half hour. Then, the women should
        remove one of their shoes and place it in the center of the area. Other articles may also be used, such as
        earrings, bras, etc. Just so long as a woman can identify it as her own and that all of the women put in the
        same type of object: i.e., one should not put in a shoe if all the others are going to put in earrings. When
        doing this, the women should form a small circle about their collection of items so the men would have
        difficulty identifying which women put in what. Then all the items should be mixed. When finished, the women
        should find places to sit by the edge of the circle while the men get up.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Now that the women have had their fun, it is the men’s turn. They also
        go around the circle feeding the women and giving them wine or water to drink. When this is finished, the men go
        to the center of the circle and face outward while holding hands. One woman claps her hands while the men walk
        in a circle clockwise around the items left by the women (more on the woman who claps the rhythm, later). When
        the clapping stops, each man reaches behind himself and, without looking, grabs one item from the collection.
        Then, once again, the men go around the circle trying to determine whose item they possess. The women may
        playfully try to hide the fact that an item belongs to them, and the men may playfully try to discover if an
        item belongs to a particular woman. This can be especially fun if the item is a woman’s bra or panties. But
        there should be no force or violence. Finally, when the man discovers whom the item belongs to, he should sit to
        her right.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">Thus are the couples formed. They should now, as pairs, feed each other, talk, joke and
        laugh, and eventually kiss gently and lovingly, though not very passionately. After some time at this, the man
        finally says to his partner,<div class="calibre20">

                couples, nor should the couples seek to caress or kiss these women. In the beginning of the ritual they

                and the men move anti-clockwise, or vice versa. When the clapping stops, each person becomes a couple

        their own abilities and successes.</span></div>

        <span class="bold1">Postscript to Lesson 10</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">As I described at the beginning of this course, I did not merely sit
        down and write this set of lessons. Rather, they began after years of study and personal practice followed by
        over ten years of giving lessons and writing. But times have definitely changed.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">When I began, the sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) of the time
        were controllable through drugs. Later came genital herpes, a disease that at the time of the first edition of
        these lessons was still untreatible. Even so, it would frequently go into remission, staying that way either
        permanently or for years at a time. Today the symptoms are somewhat treatable but still incurable.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">But a few years before the first edition of <span
          class="italic">Modern Magick</span> was published, a new disease appeared, seemingly from out of thin air.
        Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is transmitted through the sharing of bodily fluids, primarily blood.
        Some suspect other modes of transmission, but evidence of this lessens over time. A really dangerous part of
        this disease is that it may take five or more years after infection to become aware of it. If left untreated, it
        is currently almost always fatal. Today there are treatments but no cures.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Throughout this course I have stressed the idea that a magician takes
        responsibility for his or her actions. Therefore, if you decide that you wish to have more than one sexual
        partner, you must accept the responsibility for that action. If you choose to share bodily fluids with your
        partners, you and your partner must also accept the responsibility for that action. I would suggest being tested
        frequently for communicable diseases including HIV (which seems to lead to AIDS) and various STDs. If you have
        any diseases, from a communicable STD to “just a cold,” it is your responsibility to share with partners and
        potential partners the information about which diseases you have <span class="italic">before</span> having
        sex.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If you choose to have multiple partners, you do so at your own risk,
        at least until cures for AIDS and other STDs are discovered. My best friend for many years died from an
        AIDS-related condition, and he is still missed by myself and many of his friends. It is my deepest hope that a
        cure is found for those who are currently afflicted, and for those who feel angry because they must alter their
        actions in fear of this disease, that an effective preventative vaccine, or method to induce complete and
        extended remission, is soon discovered.</span></div>

        <span class="bold1">Finding Your Own Way</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">As I have previously described, there is an old legend that when Moses
        first ascended Mount Sinai, God gave to him the secrets of the Kabalah. This told humanity what it <span
          class="italic">could</span> do. Moses, upon seeing the worship of another deity&mdash;the Golden
        Calf&mdash;when he descended, destroyed public knowledge of these secrets, saving them only for his brother
        Aaron and the High Priests of Israel. When Moses again returned to the top of the mountain, he came back with
        the Decalogue, the Ten Commandments. These were filled with “thou shalt nots,” telling people what they <span
          class="italic">must not</span> do. The people were truly “children” of Israel. Children are not responsible
        for themselves and do not have the freedom that adults have. The children of Israel were not yet able to accept
        the freedom that is inherent in the Kabalah. They needed to become adults first.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Today, most people are still not able to be free. They are infected
        with the mental disease of insecurity resulting in the symptom of needing to follow various “-isms” rather than
        accepting their own excellence and thinking for themselves. Sometimes they follow these “-isms” to their death
        or cause the persecution or deaths of people following different “-isms.” People follow the doctrinal line of
        religious groups, political groups, and peer groups, or blindly follow one or more political, religious,
        military, or economic leaders. <span class="italic">Most common people are unable to think for themselves, or
          actually choose not to do so.</span> This is a result of the level of spiritual advancement in the current
        Piscean Age, and I fear it will be with us for many years to come.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">But there is hope. There are some people who are beginning to think,
        who are beginning to wake as if from a long sleep. These are the people who are the advance guard of the coming
        Aquarian Age. These are the people who either are not members of various dogma-filled organizations or stay part
        of them as long as the group does not ask for blind obedience or unethical behavior. For the most part they work
        by themselves or in very small groups of like-minded persons. They are the wave of the future and the hope of
        tomorrow.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Is this an elitist attitude? Absolutely yes . . . and absolutely no.
        For while there is an Aquarian Age elite, it is not limited to those with money or political power&mdash;or
        those with parents who had money or political power&mdash;as were previous elites. No, it is an <span
          class="italic">open</span> elite that anyone can join at any time, and make eddies, ripples, and waves in the
        ocean of our coming world.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If you have been studying and practicing the lessons of this course,
        you are well on the way to becoming a full-fledged member of this Aquarian Age elite&mdash;if you are not a
        member already. However, this does not make you better than others, just different. You should not, you must
        not, look down on others who have not advanced as far as you have. They may one day jump into the future at a
        rate accelerated even above your own.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It is said that the true deep secrets of magick cannot be told. It is
        said that the true secrets of magick are hidden and shown only to initiates of secret occult bodies such as the
        true Rosicrucians or Illuminati, and then only after the student has spent years of study and practice and has
        passed serious and even life-threatening tests.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In the past lessons I have described these things and given you
        exercises and rituals to help you develop all three of the above talents. It is interesting to note that no
        books on magick ever clearly state all of the above three points. The famous magickal texts or grimoires of the
        past at best only discuss the second point. This is because they were meant to be used as workbooks by
        experienced mages or magicians-in-training who already know these things from personal lessons and
        experience.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If you have been practicing the rituals given in this course you have
        been following a logical, tested system. This system has taught you to have a good attitude. I only briefly
        discussed this topic because I didn’t need to focus on it. Developing a positive attitude is a natural side
        effect of working with the Tarot cards and doing the Middle Pillar Ritual.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">These lessons have also taught you many ways to raise and control the
        psycho-magickal energy needed to perform magick. And, if you have been studying and practicing the techniques
        and rituals of these lessons, you will also be prepared to take the next step in your magickal
        advancement.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Let me be blunt: any person or group that claims to give you the
        ultimate magickal secrets is lying. Each person must seek it individually. The so-called “lost word” or secret
        name of God can never be communicated to you by another person. You must learn it by yourself. One way to do
        this is by following various systems or schools of magick. You are encouraged to find one that particularly fits
        your needs. However, if you have been doing the rituals of this course, you should be prepared to discover that
        information, and take the next step in learning the true, innermost secrets of magick.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If you have been <span class="italic">regularly</span> practicing the
        techniques, exercises, and rituals, you, at the very least, should have achieved or be beginning to achieve good
        control of magickal energy. The LBRP, BRH, Middle Pillar Ritual, and the Circulation of the Body of Light are
        all techniques that train a person in the ability to raise and control magickal energy. If you have made a
        talisman that has achieved its goal, you have proved to yourself the successfulness of your ability to raise and
        control Willed magickal energy.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The important part of this is your ability to use your conscious and
        unconscious Will to control magickal energy and put it to the uses you desire. Perhaps you have seen books with
        other exercises on how to raise and control magickal energy. Some are very good. But it is my feeling that
        repetition of a few basic exercises with millennia of development will work much better than spreading out your
        personal energies by memorizing large numbers of practices with fewer repetitions of each exercise.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">A positive attitude, as mentioned, should be being developed as a
        direct result of the Tarot Contemplation Ritual. Its development will also be aided by the study of the harmony
        of the universe as indicated by the balance of nature and shown on the Tree of Life. The more successes you have
        in Grey Magick, the more confident you will become in your own magickal abilities and the more positive your
        attitude will be.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There are many books with spells, rituals, ceremonies, philosophy,
        theory, and information that could help add to your knowledge of how and where to direct the raised and
        controlled energy. In fact, I could share much more. But I feel no need to do so, as it is intermediate
        information at best. Instead, I will share with you how to obtain more advanced information, the knowledge of
        true magickal secrets, for yourself.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Sometimes these “entities” are called aspects of the higher self, the
        Yeh-chee-dah. Some people call these entities manifestations of God. The process of how to reach and communicate
        with these “entities” will be discussed later in this lesson. I wish to stress that there is nothing to fear

    <h2 class="calibre29"><span class="calibre30">
        <span class="bold1">There Is Only Magick</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">If you look over the hundreds of pages of these lessons that you have
        followed so far, you will know that we have covered a tremendous amount of material. Perhaps most importantly I
        have tried to show you how to be a magician; how to think, act, and feel like a true wizard or wizardess. With
        this knowledge you should be able to construct your own rituals and ceremonies rather than being locked into the
        printed words of dead hands.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">One of the most important topics I have covered in these lessons are
        the applications and methods of White and Grey Magick, and how to avoid falling into the pit of Black Magick.
        Remember, too, that I have always maintained that not all authorities agree with my three divisions of magick. I
        gave them only so that we could communicate better. Those definitions were only a convenience. For in spite of
        what any authorities say, <span class="italic">there is no such thing as White, Black, or Grey Magick.</span>
        This is important to understand, so I’ll repeat some earlier concepts about this in a different way.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Part of the process of becoming a magician is learning to discern
        “reality” from “actuality.” Occultists have always maintained that everything is made up of vibrational energy.
        Modern scientific thought has finally come to the same conclusion, calling it “wave theory.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Yet, a wall is still a wall. A desk is still a desk. Both are really,
        truly solid. They support the weight of objects. I cannot place my hand through them without damage to the wall,
        the desk, and my hand. That is their reality. Still, both science and occultism insist that the wall and desk
        (and my hand) are only vibrational energy. That is their actuality. What is actual may not appear real. What is
        real may or may not be actual.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Likewise, some things may appear to be true, and may in reality be
        true. But their actuality may be false. It is really true that the Sun rises every morning even if the clouds
        prevent me from seeing it. That is the reality. But the actuality is that the Earth spins, giving the appearance
        that the Sun rises. In actuality, the Sun never rises.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Most of us will agree that killing is bad and evil. But people who
        believe this is so go to war and kill. Are these people hypocrites or just evil? From a magickal point of view I
        would have to say “no.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">For a true magician there is no universal, predetermined good or evil.
        There is no morality from external sources. Yet, a true magician is usually far more “moral” than his or her
        non-magician friends and neighbors, especially those professing to be highly moral. How can this be so?</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It is because a true magician understands the underpinnings of
        universe, including the laws and workings of karma. A magician realizes that he/she is totally free to choose to
        do whatever is desired. However, the true magician will invariably choose the path of light, what is called by
        non-magicians the “morally correct choice.” The true magician chooses the path of light not for moral purposes.
        Rather, this path is chosen because the magician realizes that whatever is done needs to be for the best of
        himself or herself, the local community, and the world. And further, any action they do will come back to him or
        her. Such is the universal law of karma.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">For the true magician there is no such thing as White, Grey, or Black
        Magick. There is only . . . magick. Period. It so happens that because of the understanding of the law of karma,
        a true magician will assiduously avoid what non-magicians or beginning magicians would call Black Magick.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">People who are not aware of the law of karma behave “morally” because
        they are given a code of morals or a set of laws to follow. They look to a book or leader rather than seeing the
        results of their actions. Therefore, there is always the possibility that they will break their dogmatic code.
        As a result, people who claim to be “moral” based on a human-designed set of rules are far more likely to break
        their own moral code than is a magician who follows one rule, that of karma, and does not believe in a set of
        human laws to govern morality.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Are there people who do evil? Most definitely yes. A few who do evil
        and are trained in magick, and then use magick to harm others, are called black magicians. But they should never
        be considered true magicians any more than a child performing a magic trick with a ball or coin is at the level
        of one of the performing magicians you’ve seen on TV or in the theater. Such black magicians can perform petty
        tricks but do not understand the functioning of the laws of karma. If they did, they would not do “Black
        Magick.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There is still another aspect to what some people might call Black
        Magick. If you were dying of a painful, incurable disease, might there not be the possibility that you would
        commit suicide? Some of you reading this will say, “Yes, it is a possibility.” Others will think, “Nope. No
        way.” But there are some “moralists” who would consider it wrong to commit suicide under any conditions. I am
        not trying to encourage suicide. I am merely saying that it is impossible to consider an action “good” or “bad,”
        Black Magick or otherwise, unless we know the karmic result of the action.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Most of us would agree that it would be bad for us to cut off the arm
        of a good friend. But suppose the arm was gangrenous and the friend would die if the arm was not removed. It
        would be karmically bad for us <span class="italic">not</span> to help by removing the arm and saving our
        friend. Of course, it might be the karmically correct time for the friend to go through the transition known as
        death. Then it would be karmically bad for us to save the friend’s life! As you can see, there are many
        complexities in determining the karmic “correctness” of an action. This is why doing a divination is so
        important before performing a magickal act which will affect you or your environment.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In the Biblical story, Jonah was told by God to go and preach. He
        chose not to do so and the karma of that action put him in the belly of a “great fish.” The karmically correct
        decision would have been to preach. Had a thousand people barred his way and he had to fight his way through
        them, it still would have been karmically bad for him not to preach.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If you communicate with a higher, spiritual entity and decide to
        follow or not follow the advice of that entity, you will be responsible for the karmic result of your actions
        (or lack thereof). If you decide to do something which agrees with instructions from higher entities, and
        someone tells you “No,” it is karmically correct for you to disagree with that person and even push him or her
        out of the way if need be. But remember, you will be karmically responsible for whatever happens. Especially
        because you are a magician, you must accept responsibility for all of your actions. What you are now is a direct
        result of what you did yesterday. What you are tomorrow is a direct result of what you do today. As you sow, so
        shall you reap. It is the law of karma.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Discovering things from higher, spiritual entities on other planes of
        existence and deciding to do them is called “finding your True Will.” And, as St. Augustine, Rabelais, and
        Aleister Crowley said, “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This is not a license for hedonism and what some people may call
        immorality. In fact, just the contrary is true. In reality it is a call to become responsible for your own
        actions, to become united with Divinity and to make God’s Will your Will. Your actions will require that you
        ever tread the path of Light. And the guide on that path is love. For as Crowley added, “Love is the law, love
        under will.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Every once in a while, the sensationalistic press will tell the story
        of a man or woman who did something terrible such as beating a spouse or child to death because their victim
        “was possessed by the devil.” Some add, “God told me to do this.” The training in this book does not increase
        the possibility that you may become demented enough to do such a thing. In fact, it helps prevent it. We are not
        dealing with mediumship or possession. We will be dealing with communication.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Furthermore, there is always a simple way to decide if something is
        correct for you. You should have noticed that over the past few months, as you have been practicing the rituals
        and techniques of this course, your intuition has improved. This is a natural result of the rituals and
        exercises that you have been doing. So if something doesn’t seem right or feel right to you, <span
          class="italic">don’t do it!</span> It’s that simple.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If you have a feeling that someone you know may be “possessed by the
        devil” and you have a desire to make that devil leave by doing bodily harm to the person “possessed,” <span
          class="italic">don’t do it!</span> It may be you who needs help.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">The systems that I will share with you are quite safe. Since some people are concerned
        about direct communication with higher, spiritual entities, as opposed to the somewhat indirect communications
        of magickal evocation, let me repeat here:<div class="calibre20">

    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">I have written on other pages about the “Little Nasties” and how they
        can be bothersome. I discussed earlier in this lesson that when you come into contact with higher spiritual
        entities, you should listen to what they have to say. As you may have guessed, I did not mean that you should
        obey the Little Nasties! Little Nasties, being denizens of what some people call the lower astral plane, are not
        higher spiritual entities. What I mean by higher spiritual entities are three things: direct manifestations of
        the Divine (the gods), the Archangels, and the Orders of Angels. Furthermore, you may need to make tests to see
        if these entities are the spiritual beings they claim to be. How to do this will be explained shortly.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">But first, let’s look at entities that, though ethereal and existing
        primarily on other planes, are not higher spiritual entities.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Etheric Body:</span> This is an emanation of all
        created things. It is not the true astral double and is something like “halfway between astral and physical.” It
        sometimes can take on the appearance of a person on a higher plane, but is always attached to a living
        being.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Astral Body:</span> This is a manifestation of
        the spiritual aspect of a living entity. Again, it is always attached to an incarnate being. When detached, it
        quickly moves to higher planes of existence in order to reincarnate. In this disattached condition they are too
        busy to occupy your time. When attached to some individual ego, they can be seen as such. Higher spiritual
        entities are not linked to a particular ego.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Azoth:</span> This is also known by the Sanskrit
        term “Akasha” (correct pronunciation: “ah-kash”) or the astral light. It appears as brightness and is changeable
        according to a person’s will. The past, present, and future can be seen within the Azoth, but it does not have
        an independent personality. Since futures are only possible futures, getting lost in the astral light can lead
        to your ignoring the present. This can lead you to the home for “Space Cadets.” Remember to keep your feet
        firmly planted in the present.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Artificial Elementals:</span> These are entities
        created by human forces and are composed of only one element. They are focused toward one purpose, so if you
        leave them alone they will ignore you. Depending upon the strength of the will of their creator, they will
        appear more or less gaunt when seen on the astral plane.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">The Empty Ones:</span> If you live in a large
        city, these entities can be seen in physical form in the “skid row” section of town. They look human, but they
        have no soul and no hope for the future. They can sometimes show great humor and daring, but quickly fade into
        the depths of despair. Their eyes show either madness or emptiness. These poor creatures also exist on higher
        planes. Their touch brings despair and fear.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Elementaries:</span> These are the Gnomes of
        Earth, Undines of Water, Sylphs of Air, and Salamanders of Fire. They are usually called “elementals,” and
        although that isn’t exactly accurate, I have used that term in these lessons. Although composed of only one
        element, they have their own will and usually do not bother humans. In fact, they prefer it if humans ignore
        them.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Larvae:</span> These are also known as lemures.
        It is believed that they live off the essence of blood. They “feed,” so to speak, on sick or injured people.
        They can be dispersed easily by a projection of pure spiritual white light.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Ghosts:</span> When the astral body separates
        from the ego, it normally moves to a position where it can reincarnate. Sometimes a strong desire for the
        physical world (or something in the physical world) keeps an astral body in the lowest of the spiritual planes.
        In this condition they are known as ghosts. They tend to be quite sorrowful or angry and even filled with rage
        causing their refusal to evolve. Encouraging their evolution may or may not be successful, but it will give you
        karmic “brownie points.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Pseudo-Ghosts:</span> These are not related to
        true ghosts. They’re closer to the Little Nasties. They “feed” off any energy given to them and will imitate the
        actions of ghosts in order to get people to pay attention and give them energy. By reading the Astral Light they
        can know your past and probable future, and thus may appear at séances under the guise of a deceased loved one.
        They are more bothersome on the physical plane than on any higher plane.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Poltergeists:</span> The poltergeist phenomenon
        often gives the appearance of being a ghost. However, it is actually a manifestation of the unconscious of a
        human, most frequently (but not always) a girl entering puberty. The word itself is German for “noisy spirit”
        and that’s what occurs&mdash;the poltergeist makes noises, knocks things off shelves, and has even been known to
        attack people. It is rare for a poltergeist to directly harm someone, but they can push over bookcases, cause
        people to trip at the top of stairs, etc. Thus, they can indirectly cause harm. The best way to deal with
        poltergeist phenomena is to get children in a home where it occurs into some form of therapy. Most often,
        poltergeist phenomena cease as the child matures, but it can return at unexpected times.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">These and other entities exist on the higher planes. Those of a single
        mind will not harm you unless you try to stop them from achieving their goals. Those connected to entities on
        the physical plane are usually too involved with the physical plane to bother you. There is one type of entity
        that exists on higher planes that can be problematical: your own thought forms.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Here, “form” is the keyword. On higher planes thoughts take on various
        forms representing their nature, and, unfortunately, you do not have to consciously create them. This was
        fictionalized in the famous 1956 science-fiction movie <span class="italic">Forbidden Planet</span>, where
        machines created a horrendous attacker, a “monster from the Id.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Thus, on higher planes you may come into contact with ugly, foul
        monsters of hideous appearance who attempt to stop you from achieving your goals. They are only your own fears,
        angers, prejudices, etc. They will not harm you themselves, for to harm you would cause harm to themselves. They
        <span class="italic">are</span> you.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Most people are unwilling or too frightened to examine or even peek at
        their <span class="italic">shadow</span>, the Jungian term for the darker side of themselves, so they’ll run in
        terror at the sight of their own negative thought forms. This can keep you from accomplishing your goal of
        direct communication with higher spiritual entities.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Visualizing a pentagram of bright blue light specked with brilliant
        gold flecks and “shooting” it out at them as in the section of this course on psychic self-defense will keep
        them away. Through banishings, the attack may be temporarily stopped, but it will not end until the magician has
        dealt with and conquered the inner source of the negative thought form. So if you find yourself frequently
        thinking you are under psychic attack, even though you have used the techniques described earlier in these
        lessons to rid yourself of such attacks, you may have to look at yourself as the cause. The only way to really
        get rid of them is to face them and your fear, and overcome the negative aspect(s) of yourself that created
        them. Few magicians are ever really psychically attacked.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Please understand that I am not encouraging you to stay and face the
        monsters of your own inner self, monsters that we all have. In this type of battle it is a wise person who runs
        away and “lives to fight another day.” Rather, I am suggesting that at a future time you may need to deal with
        those self-created beings through some sort of focused introspection or professional therapy. Sooner or later
        you will have to face and conquer your own demons, and you will be happier for it.</span></div>

        </span></span></h1>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">In Part One of this lesson I explained that I would share with you how
        to learn the ultimate secrets of magick, although I cannot share the actual secrets themselves. This is because
        each person must learn these secrets for him/herself and prove his or her worth and readiness. Also, the secrets
        are of a very subjective nature. What may be the ultimate secrets of magick for you might not be for another
        aspirant.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">However, if you think that you will begin to learn the techniques for
        this discovery in this lesson you will be wrong. You will not <span class="italic">begin</span> to learn the
        techniques here because you have already begun to learn them from the very first lesson of this course!</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">Up to this time, without dwelling on it, I have been directing you in the method of how to
        obtain the desired information and secrets. I have not brought your attention to it because some people seem to
        fear what is represented by two small words. Frankly, I cannot understand this fear because the process named by
        those two words is something these same people do every day of their lives. However, they do it without control.
        When this process is controlled by a firm Magickal Will (something you have been developing by following these
        lessons and doing the rituals and exercises), however, it seems to scare some people. This is foolish, as there
        is nothing to fear from something you ordinarily do so easily. It is quite common. And the two words that
        describe it are...<div class="calibre20">

        <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Don’t feel uncomfortable with the idea of astral projection. You do it
        every time you daydream, and very frequently when you dream in your sleep.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Astral travel</span>, which is what you may do
        after astral projection, is also very common and natural. In fact, you probably had to <span
          class="italic">unlearn</span> how to astral travel when you were a child. It is very common for parents to
        tell their children not to play in invisible scenes and with invisible play-friends. Some
        children&mdash;especially in our MTV world with colorful and fast-moving toys&mdash;simply grow out of using
        their astral vision (and their imagination) where they saw these characters and vistas. These were scenes and
        entities on and from the astral plane.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">You may remember some of this type of childhood experience in a very
        superficial way. Very few people remember their extreme youth in detail. Because elders would tell you “Come
        back to reality!” and “Don’t play foolish games!” and, perhaps worst of all, “Quit pretending!” it was
        eventually impressed into your conscious to forget those invisibles which are “see-able” on the astral plane.
        This process of causing yourself to forget those things that would be uncomfortable or unacceptable to your
        current state of consciousness is what psychotherapists call “motivated forgetting.” It is one of the reasons
        why most people remember little of their infancy; it was so childish and embarrassing not to be able to walk,
        communicate, take care of yourself, or even control your bowels that you <span class="italic">want</span> to
        forget.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As you may recall, I said at the beginning of this course that your
        daily ritual practice would become shorter. Part of that is because you would memorize the rituals and be able
        to be effective more quickly than when you started. Now, however, it will also be because you will be able to do
        all of your regular daily ritual work totally astrally. Remember, the physical actions of a ritual work to
        impress the unconscious and reinforce the conscious with what is being done in the astral plane. All of the work
        you have been doing for many months has created memory and habit patterns in your unconscious mind. That means
        you can accomplish the same goal <span class="italic">without</span> physically performing the ritual. Of
        course, if you wish you may continue with your regular daily rituals&mdash;you can do them for the rest of your
        life and they will get better and help your life become more positive and more successful. However, starting
        today, you can move to the next level, begin bypassing the physical and go directly to the astral plane by doing
        the following ritual:</span></div>
  </div>

  <div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-8">
    <h2 class="calibre29"><span class="calibre30">
        <span class="bold1">Astral Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Preparation:</span> Until you have practiced this
        form of the ritual at <span class="italic">least</span> twenty times and are sure of its effectiveness, begin by
        doing a regular, physical LBRP. If time allows, also do the BRH.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP ONE</span>. Sit in the center of your circle
        and relax with some steady deep breathing and the Relaxation Ritual. You should be facing the east. Your eyes
        should be closed and your arms and legs should not be crossed.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP TWO</span>. Visualize yourself (or, if you
        prefer, an idealized image of yourself) standing, facing you. Take some time and get the best image possible in
        your mind. Remember, even if you can’t see the visualization with your astral vision, you should know beyond any
        doubt that it is there and if your vision were open you would see it.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP THREE</span>. Once your double (frequently
        called a doppelganger) is complete, use your will power and have it turn to face the east, the same direction in
        which you are looking. This procedure should take no special ritual techniques. Simply use your mind to tell it
        silently to turn about and it will do so. Of course, it should still be standing.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP FOUR</span>. Now, without audibly saying
        anything, will your twin to do the entire Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram. Your physical body should be
        in the center of the area, the position where your physical altar would normally be located. Try to hear, feel,
        smell, sense, and visualize everything your double does. Keep your physical eyes closed.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP FIVE</span>. Once you have completed this
        astral performance of the LBRP, have your double sit in your lap and allow yourself to reabsorb it. Take some
        deep breaths to unite yourselves. Clap your hands loudly three times. The sound will help bring you back to
        normal consciousness. Now you may open your eyes.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Postscript:</span> After you have done the astral
        Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, be sure to again perform the LBRP <span
          class="italic">physically</span>. Do this until you have performed the astral version at least <span
          class="italic">thirty</span> (not twenty) times. If you are not satisfied that the astral LBRP was effective
        after those thirty times, continue doing a physical LBRP after the astral version until you are convinced that
        the astral version has been effective.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As usual, be sure to record the results of the ritual in your magickal
        or ritual diary.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The astral LBRP may sound quite easy to do from the description above.
        “Hey, all I have to do is sit on my behind and think it out. No tools or robes. That’s easy!” Actually, although
        it may sound or seem a great deal easier than other rituals you have performed, this ritual takes as much or
        more concentration than <span class="italic">any</span> rituals you have done so far in this course. If you find
        yourself getting lost or falling asleep, just stop where you are and perform the LBRP physically. Simply follow
        the directions and add nothing to them. Nothing “bad” can happen to you.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If you have trouble concentrating to a level where you can do the
        entire LBRP in this above astral fashion, try practicing the following concentration exercise:</span></div>
    <h2 class="calibre29"><span class="calibre30">
        <span class="bold1">Exercise to Improve Concentration</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Needed:</span> a timer and four cards. The cards
        should be pure white with no lines. On the first card place a large black spot, and on the second place two
        spots side by side. On the third card make a row of three spots and on the fourth card, a similar row of four
        spots. A black marker is perfect for making such cards, although if you are comfortable using graphic programs
        on your computer, you may wish to create your cards that way.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre2"><img alt="196" src="images/000025.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre12"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">Concentration Exercise Cards</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre13">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Set the timer for five minutes. Look at Card One until you have a very
        good idea of that single spot. Burn it into your mind. Now close your eyes and only think of that spot. You will
        see in your mind’s eye an image of the card. It may not be perfect. It may be reversed or a shade of what you
        saw. That’s exactly what it should be.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This is not some magickal power, it is physiological. The mind records
        an image and holds on to it as an “afterimage.” In this exercise we are working with it to attune your mind to
        improve its visualization abilities. If the image in your mind begins to drift to a side, just let it return to
        the center of your focus. If any other thoughts come into your mind, simply bring back your focus to that one
        spot. Cease the exercise when you can no longer see the spot or when the timer goes off. Your goal in this
        exercise is to keep that single spot visualized in one location for five minutes while you allow nothing to
        interfere with your concentration. Practice once or twice daily.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">When you have very few breaks in your concentration, move on to Card
        Two with the two spots and repeat the exercise. Continue this practice until you can keep the two spots in your
        mind for the full five minutes. When you can do this with Card Three and then Card Four and its four dots, you
        will have excellent concentration abilities.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Although this exercise sounds easy, it is not. The first time I tried
        it, I broke out into a sweat and was drenched within five minutes. Do not underestimate its difficulty.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">On the other hand, you may find that the Astral LBRP is easy for you
        to do. You may be able to mentally see your doppelganger perform every action and hear it sound every
        vocalization. If this is the case, or after you increase your concentration and visualization abilities until
        you reach this level, add to it an astral version of the BRH, the Middle Pillar Ritual, and the Circulation of
        the Body of Light. Eventually you should be able to do <span class="italic">all</span> of these rituals
        astrally. Then, even a few minutes with your eyes closed should equal what is now taking you much longer on the
        physical plane. Although your daily ritual work should still be done every day, you will reach a time when you
        will rarely have to do them physically. You will, of course, do most of the so-called Grey Magick rituals on the
        physical plane, and also those rituals wherein you delve into the deepest realms of the Magickal Arte.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Some of you who have read about or practiced astral projection and
        astral travel may be thinking, “Wait a minute, what you described as the Astral LBRP doesn’t involve real astral
        projection at all!” Yeaaah. Okay. I confess. You’re right. This is true.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There are two techniques that are frequently called astral projection.
        The first one is often mistaken for astral projection but is nothing of the kind. It is actually <span
          class="italic">mental projection</span>. In mental projection you send your mind and senses away from your
        body by force of will. You still will retain your consciousness and some sense awareness in your physical body.
        Another name for this is <span class="italic">bi-locationality</span>.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In true astral projection the consciousness almost totally leaves the
        physical and joins the astral double. The physical body appears to be sleeping or in a coma. If you have
        forgotten about how the astral plane works, and how everything has an astral double, now is the time to re-read
        Lessons Five and Seven.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In the astral LBRP just described, all you are doing is using your
        powers of visualization and your imagination. You are not doing astral or even mental projection. But look again
        at Step Four: “Hear, feel, smell, sense, and visualize everything your double does.” By doing this, eventually,
        and quite naturally, you will experience bi-locationality. This will occur when you are open and ready for it.
        You will have an awareness of both your physical self and your astral body. Another possibility is that your
        consciousness may seem to jump back and forth between the two forms.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Then, quite naturally and without any sort of force, you will realize
        that for some time, when doing the ritual you have not been aware of your physical body. It is at this time that
        you are experiencing true astral projection. When you have this realization my advice to you is the same as the
        words of Douglas Adams in <span class="italic">The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</span>: “Don’t
        panic!”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Some people, when realizing that they are on the astral plane, really
        don’t know what to do and seek to return to their normal condition as quickly as possible. I suggest that
        instead you use your mind to take a few deep (astral) breaths, relax, and try to get comfortable in your astral
        form and get used to the way it feels to be out-of-body. This will make the projection of the astral body easier
        as time goes on. It’s also exhilarating and liberating if you simply allow yourself to revel in the
        feelings.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If you would like to try some other methods for projecting your astral
        body and traveling on the astral plane, here are some good ones. They are based on some practical techniques by
        the author Ophiel (<span class="italic">née</span> Edward Peach). Remember, however, to always perform the LBRP
        (and BRH if time allows) before doing any projection. This cannot be overemphasized. Remember, you’re a magician
        now, not a dilettante.</span></div>
    <h3 class="calibre32"><span class="calibre33"><span class="italic1">
          <span class="italic1"><span class="bold1">Method One</span></span>
        </span></span></h3>
    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Step One</span>. Start off by placing some
        markers around your room or home. These markers could include such things as a rose, a bowl of cold water, a
        shoe, etc. They should be things that can be appreciated by all of your senses: touch, hearing, taste, smell,
        and sight. Now lie down on your bed. Next, get up and make a circle, going from one marker to the next before
        returning to your bed. Involve your senses with each of the markers. Smell the rose. Feel the softness of the
        petals. Feel the cool wetness of the water. Taste it and pay attention to how it feels in your mouth, throat,
        and stomach. Feel the texture of the rubber of the sole of the shoe. Smell the rubber. After you have completed
        the circle, experiencing each item, lie down on your bed in your original supine position. Repeat this several
        times. In fact, you may wish to make this a multiday exercise, repeating this first step for several
        days.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Step Two</span>. While lying in the bed,
        visualize above you a cloud of purest white. It may remain as a cloud or you can form it into the shape of your
        own body (idealized if desired). You may notice a connection between your physical body and your double in the
        form of an umbilical-like cord at your navel, solar plexus, third eye area, or at the top of your head. People
        experience this cord in different places, although you may not notice it at all. In your mind’s eye, make this
        cloud or figure and fill it with as much detail as possible.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Step Three</span>. Now, will the cloud or double
        to circle around the markers following the same path that you had taken earlier. If you noticed the cord, you
        can see that it will stretch indefinitely. Have the double or cloud interact with each item as you had
        physically done earlier. Smell and touch the rose, feel and taste that water, feel and smell the shoe,
        etc.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Eventually this imaginary tour will change to bi-locationality and
        finally to astral projection. Once you have attained these states, there is no need to limit yourself as to
        where you can go. Feel free to visit a friend’s home. Remember that you are learning a new skill, so don’t try
        to go too far until you are very comfortable with the experience.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Step Four</span>. No matter what level you are
        at, even if you are only using imagination, always re-absorb the double or cloud back into your physical body
        when you have completed your journey. Also, always end with a banishing ritual and record your results in your
        diary.</span></div>
    <h3 class="calibre32"><span class="calibre33"><span class="italic1">
          <span class="italic1"><span class="bold1">Method Two</span></span>
        </span></span></h3>
    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Step One</span>. This is similar to method one.
        Either lie down or sit in a chair. Begin by visualizing a cloud in front of you (or over you if you are lying
        down). If you wish, you may form it into a double of yourself.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Step Two</span>. Now, firmly desire to transfer
        your consciousness to the double. If you feel a sudden change in your body, described by some as a lightening or
        vibrating feeling, will yourself to open your eyes. Do not try to physically open your eyes by using your
        muscles. Just will yourself to see. Do not be surprised when you see your physical body in front of you.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Step Three</span>. Spend no more than three
        minutes concentrating on trying to cause your consciousness to leave your body and join your astral self. If it
        works, fine. If it doesn’t work in about three minutes, that is fine, too. Relax, take some deep breaths, and
        try again tomorrow.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The key to succeeding with this system (and with all of the methods,
        really) is that you must establish within yourself <span class="italic">the urgent desire to leave your physical
          body</span>. When you finally succeed&mdash;and with dedication, desire, and regular practice you certainly
        will succeed&mdash;be sure to re-absorb the double into your physical body when you conclude the projection. Of
        course, do banishings before and after and record your results.</span></div>
    <h3 class="calibre32"><span class="calibre33"><span class="italic1">
          <span class="italic1"><span class="bold1">Method Three</span></span>
        </span></span></h3>

        your physical body, imagine your consciousness going with the astral body. When finished, reabsorb the double

    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">This method is ideal for musicians and music lovers. It was the method
        I used to achieve my first out-of-body experience.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Step One</span>. Hear the musical note D natural
        above middle C in your mind. A little practice with a piano, pitch pipe, or a friend with a musical instrument
        will make this pitch familiar to you. Now, double the frequency of the pitch in your mind so that you hear a
        pitch an octave higher than the first note. If you are not a musician, a friend with musical knowledge can help
        you with this.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Step Two</span>. Again hear the tone, only an
        additional octave higher, then hear it an octave above that. Continue this process until you are far above a

    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Step Three.</span> You will notice that you are
        feeling lighter as the note goes up in pitch. You may sense a vibration in your head. Let the sound rise higher
        and higher as you feel <span class="italic">the sound</span> rise toward the ceiling of your room. When you
        sense that the sound is as high as it can go, both as a pitch and within the confines of the room, will your
        eyes to open. Again, don’t be surprised if you see your physical body below. When finished, allow the double to

      <div class="calibre19">The methods of astral projection and astral travel presented here are enough for anyone to
        learn from. If you desire more information, look at some of the books in this lesson’s bibliography. But be
        aware that each of the books are limited by preconceived notions of the authors. Set yourself no limits and you
        will have none. And besides, I believe it is far better to learn by doing than by reading. As I wrote earlier in
        this course:<div class="calibre20">

        understand.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Some students have expressed concerns about “being lost in the astral”
        and not being able to come back to their physical bodies. If you follow the instructions given in this lesson,
        it simply cannot happen. You have a direct link to your body via the cord mentioned earlier. This is true even
        if you, like some people, are not aware of the existence of the cord. The only time “getting lost” can occur is
        if you stray too far from your physical body. The relative expression “too far” is not a question of yards or
        miles. For lack of a better comparison, I like to say that it refers to hundreds of light years. Simply stay
        near your body while you are learning and you will have no such problem whatsoever.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In fact, the biggest problem for most people is getting out of the
        body in the first place. The next big problem is staying out. Getting back is not a problem at all. To initially
        get out you must truly desire to leave your body and approach the entire idea of the astral by knowing that it
        is beautiful, stimulating, safe, exciting, and fun!</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There is one problem, rarely mentioned due to its lack of seriousness.
        It can occur to beginners and longtime veterans of astral projection and travel. It is what is known as “astral
        whiplash.” Sometimes, when you are out-of-body, something can jar your physical body enough to suddenly draw
        your astral body back into your physical self. This can be from a knock on the door, a phone ringing, a car
        backfiring, or a friend nudging you and asking you, “Hey, are you asleep?”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The result of this whiplash back into your physical body is that you
        may feel groggy, sore all over, tired, and you may get a headache. When you project, astral “substance” (it has
        gone under many names) comes out of your physical body and unites with your astral body by way of the
        aforementioned cord. Coming back too quickly can result in leaving some of this “substance” still out on the
        astral plane. It is this loss that causes the minor physical problems mentioned above. This is one reason why
        you should always allow the double to be absorbed by the physical body after you finish your projection.</span>

          <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
          <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Although it happened many years ago, I still remember my first
              experience with astral projection. I was in my girlfriend’s dorm room. “Let’s try something,” she said.
              Being a typical horny young man, ready to try just about anything, I, of course, agreed.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">She had me lie down on her bed, face up. Then she had me close
              my eyes and take some deep breaths to slowly relax. “Now, listen to this sound.” She gently blew into her
              pitch pipe (we had met in a music class). I heard the familiar, reedy sound, and it was comforting.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">“Think of an octave higher,” she said. “Focus on it and go with
              it.” That was easy. I just thought of an octave higher and was there.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">“Now go an octave above that.” I nodded when I had done
              that.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">“Now go an octave above that . . . and an octave above
              that.”</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This continued a few more times and I realized that I was
              hearing a pitch in my mind that was above the human vocal range. In fact, the tone I heard was above any
              instrument I knew. This was getting really weird.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Somehow, she picked up on this and had me take a deep breath. As
              I exhaled, she pressed gently on my shoulder. It calmed me.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">“Now go an octave higher . . . and an octave higher.” Going so
              high, beyond hearing, was confusing and yet oddly freeing and liberating.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">“Okay. Don’t open your physical eyes, but just will your eyes to
              open.”</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Huh? What the heck did that mean? How can you open your eyes
              without opening your eyes?</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">“Just will your eyes to open and let your physical eyes
              rest.”</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Okay. I’ll give it a try. Slowly, I willed my eyes to open. At
              first there was a blur. Then there was a clear focus. I could see myself on the bed directly below me. My
              girlfriend still had her hand on my shoulder. I was at the ceiling of the room.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">“I’m doing it!” I thought. “I’m really astral projecting! This
              is incredible.” I willed myself to fly around the room. It was a feeling of total freedom and
              liberation.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">And then I thought, “Wait a minute. <span class="italic">I’m
                really doing this</span>&mdash;I’m really astral projecting! Aaaaaghhhhh!!!”</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Bam! I was suddenly back in my body, jerking up. My girlfriend’s
              hand gently pressed me back down and I caught my breath. In a few moments I developed a headache from the
              astral whiplash, but it was worth it. Astral projection is an incredible experience, and this just began
              my future astral adventures.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Thank you, C.G., for giving me my first taste of the astral
              planes.</span></div>

      </blockquote>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I experienced astral whiplash on my first successful attempt at astral
        projection. When I willed my eyes to open, I suddenly realized that I was floating at the top of the room and
        could see my body below me. The excitement and exhilaration was too much, and, wham, I was back in my body.
        Luckily, I had not gone too far and I only ended up with a headache and feeling a little groggy. Some deep
        breathing and a drink of cool, fresh water fixed that.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If you ever have a problem with astral whiplash, and you were not
        really close to your body when the whiplash occurred, there is a simple remedy for any of the symptoms
        associated with it. Re-project yourself to the same place to which you went when you were interrupted. Then
        return to your physical body in your normal fashion, generally by retracing the way you came. You will
        automatically collect whatever substance was lost. If you do not have a chance to re-project, the feelings
        resulting from astral whiplash will fade in a few hours or after you have a good sleep.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Perhaps the best solution to astral whiplash caused by an interruption
        from an outsider would be prevention. Before attempting any projection, turn your phone off and tell anybody
        else in your home that you are not to be disturbed for the next hour.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">At this time there is no need for you to travel far once you have the
        knack of projection. However, it is important to include in your Tarot Contemplation Ritual the aspect of
        imagining yourself in the chosen card and looking beyond the edge of the card if you are not doing so already.
        This and astral projection come together in the next part of this lesson. You may wish to practice both the
        advanced Tarot Contemplation Ritual and astral projection for a few days or weeks until you have at least a
        minimal efficiency with both before moving to the next part of this lesson.</span></div>

        <span class="bold1">The Magickal Value of Astral Projection</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">So far I have explained techniques for mental and astral projection
        plus the very beginning techniques of working magickally while in the astral plane, what is commonly known as
        astral traveling.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I have also advised you to spend some time&mdash;days or even
        weeks&mdash;before going on to this section. I remember how excited I was when I first projected and how I
        quickly wanted to move on with my practices. So if you are quickly going ahead there is no need to
        apologize.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">You are not expected to have achieved immediate success with the
        techniques. Very few people I have talked with do, and I know that it took me quite some time to get any real
        control. It may take you weeks or even months of daily work to perfect. It is better to practice for fifteen
        minutes, or even only five minutes, every day, than it is to practice for one hour once a week. <span
          class="italic">Persevere and you will succeed.</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">But, so what? Once you are able to freely project your consciousness
        into your astral body and travel around in that state, what good will it do you? Why even learn how to astral
        project in the first place? Sure, it is fun and exhilarating, but going to a movie can be fun and going dancing
        can be exhilarating. And moviegoing and dancing take a great deal less preparation and practice.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There are many books that discuss how wonderful it is to be
        out-of-body. But once you achieve the ability of projection, few of the books discuss what to do with it. Some
        say you can contact friends or visit the Moon or any other of a variety of more or less mundane things.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Why bother? I can call my friends on the phone or drive over and visit
        them. And although visiting the Moon might be interesting, it is not at the top of my “things to do” list. And
        why, if the goal of astral projection is so relatively mundane, have occult schools and fraternities from the
        earliest dates of recorded history stressed the importance of learning how to project?</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As I have made clear, the purpose of this course is to introduce you
        to various magickal topics so that you can direct yourself in your lifelong study of the occult. This lesson is
        specifically focused toward being a guide for your future study of metaphysics. In this lesson you are learning
        techniques that can give you <span class="italic">every magickal secret known and unknown to
          humanity!</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">With these techniques you can achieve whatever you want in life, both
        spiritually and materially. Few people know about it because real magicians have tried to keep it a secret from
        mere dabblers in the occult sciences.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">It has been necessary to withhold this ultimate secret of magick from you until now for two
        reasons:<div class="calibre24">
          <div class="calibre25">
            <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">1. You had to prove your readiness to receive the
                information by sticking through this course. You don’t have to prove it to me or to anyone else. You
                needed to prove it to yourself. You needed to develop a justifiable sense that you have earned the right
                to move on. And just to help you in your recall, I want you to know this: right now, if you study not
                one more word of this course, nor read any other book, you probably know more about the theory and
                practice of real, traditional Western magick than 99.99 percent of the people in this world. In fact,
                you probably know more about the theory and practice of real, traditional Western magick than most of
                those who claim to be ceremonial magicians. You have earned the right to have this information by your
                diligence. This is especially true if you have been practicing the exercises and rituals.</span>

          </div>
          <div class="calibre25">
            <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">2. According to Eliphas Levi, telling the truth to
                someone who cannot accept it is tantamount to telling that person a lie. I could have given you this
                information in the first lesson of this course, but you would not have been able to use it. Thus, it
                would have been meaningless or a lie to you. In order to make use of this knowledge, you needed to
                develop all of the techniques and talents you have worked with in these lessons. This course is
                cumulative.</span></blockquote>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The technique I will be sharing involves the use of the Tarot,
        Kabalistic correspondences, and understanding how to do ritual magick plus having the ability to raise, control,
        and direct the magickal energy and project to the astral plane. In fact, this technique is the reason for
        learning astral projection. It has long been kept a secret. It is called <span class="italic">Kabalistic
          Pathworking</span>.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Before discussing how to do Kabalistic Pathworking, there is some
        preliminary information that you must have. One of the best writers on magick and the Kabalah, Israel Regardie,
        at one time claimed that the Tree of Life is a convenient tool for memorization and categorization. While to an
        extent this is true, it does not go far enough, for the <span class="italic">Tree of Life is also a map of the
          astral planes</span>. Magicians can use this map to chart their ways to meeting with higher spiritual
        entities, non-physical consciousnesses capable of giving any information needed. This is why the study of the
        Tree of Life is so vitally important to all Western ritual or ceremonial magicians.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Kabalistic Pathworking, quite simply, is the process of using this map
        to go to the location of some higher spiritual entity. In a sense it is the exact reverse of evocation. Rather
        than bring a spirit to you, you go to it.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">On the astral Tree of Life road you may encounter any or all of the
        appropriate Kabalistic correspondences for a particular path or Sephira. You may also encounter any of the lower
        non-physical beings described earlier in this lesson. Each journey up and down the Tree of Life will be unique,
        although it may have similarities with other such journeys. Therefore, you cannot depend upon what others have
        written. “<span class="italic">There is no room for authority in occultism</span>” (Dion Fortune). What you can
        depend upon is your own Kabalistic knowledge and magickal ability. Now, perhaps, you can see more clearly one of
        the reasons I have had to wait until this lesson to describe this technique.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I think that the best way to show you what Kabalistic Pathworking is
        like is to give you an example of a Kabalistic Pathworking experience. Please remember that merely because
        someone else has done this does not mean that it will be correct for you. Kabalistic Pathworking, like our
        physical world, is real, and like the physical world, it is interpreted through our senses and our minds.
        Therefore, it becomes highly subjective. True, for the person experiencing it, the Kabalistic Pathworking is
        real. Merely because something is real does not mean that it is actual. It only means that it is our present
        interpretation of what is actual.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Because Kabalistic Pathworking is so intensely personal and important,
        none of my students have ever told me that they were willing to have their magickal record of a Kabalistic
        Pathworking published. I feel the same way about my own Kabalistic Pathworking experiences. Therefore, as an
        example of a Kabalistic Pathworking, I am going to present to you a version adapted from a rare book from 1968
        titled <span class="italic">The New Dimensions Red Book.</span> Although this was a group working, it has some
        valid points which make it very similar to the Kabalistic Pathworking I will be describing. I have altered it
        greatly to make it more similar to a Kabalistic Pathworking you might have.</span></div>

        in mists. This room may be the same size as my physical room, or it may be infinitely large. I have no way of
        knowing. Frankly, this scares me a bit and to calm myself I perform the LBRP. I see new and very bright blue
        stars and luminescent white lines going over those which I had already created. Then I perform the Rose Cross
        Ritual. It gives me a feeling of quiet calmness.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">To the east, from out of the mists, I see three doors appear. The door
        to my left is a huge card of the Tarot, card 20, Judgement. To the right the door is card 19, the Moon. Due
        east, between the other card-doors, is a door upon which is card 21, the Universe. Ahead also is an enormous
        figure. It is my personal temple’s guardian, whose name is _____________. I know that I can leave both my temple
        and my physical body safely entrusted to my guardian’s care.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This night I have chosen to work up the path of the Universe. It will
        take me from Mahlkoot, our Earth and my temple, to Yesode, the Sphere of the Moon. I step toward the middle
        door. The door seems to grow until it is all that I can see. Instead of opening it, I will myself to become the
        figure in the card. Instantly, we are one.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I find myself floating in a cloud-filled void, but I feel no fear,
        only joy. I am surrounded by a huge green wreath, and the only other entities I can see are the kerubic
        creatures of Ezekiel’s Revelation: a Bull, an Eagle, a Lion, and a Man. I look around and eventually a path
        becomes clear. I walk away from the wreath and the four creatures, and move down the path.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The path is straight, but to either side it is very dark. Every so
        often I see an image, a tableau of great interest, on either side of the path. But rather than waste time,
        observing what is going on, I continue along the straight and narrow.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">After a long walk, I come to a sort of ocean or lake. There is
        something shimmering in the distance, but I cannot make out what is there. In front of me is large,
        flat-bottomed boat. Its oarsman is the strongest-looking person I have ever seen. He would make almost every
        bodybuilder hide in shame. He beckons me onto the boat, so I enter and carefully sit down. He rows swiftly
        toward the glittering in the distance.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">When we arrive, I see that it is a brilliant, white island. I tell the
        oarsman to approach, but instead he stares at me as if expecting more from me. I do not know what he wants.
        Rather than approaching the island, he rows around it. Quickly coming into my vision is the most beautiful young
        woman I have ever seen. She looks like she is perhaps twenty years old. Her body has not yet fully matured but
        is still excellent to behold. About the only thing whiter and more pure than her skin is her unusual white hair.
        Her blue eyes look questioningly beyond me, as if trying to learn the mysteries of the universe. She is both
        virginal and sexy at the same time. I am virtually breathtaken at her youthful beauty.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As we move further around the island, another woman comes into view. I
        can’t guess her age, for she could pass as any age between her late twenties and late fifties. She is
        magnificently beautiful, too, but her beauty is not that of a young girl. Everything about her says
        “woman.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">Her body is full with large but firm breasts and hips jutting out from a slender waist. Her
        skin is incredibly pure, and her white hair is puffed out to form a huge halo about her face. Her eyes are of
        the deepest azure. Almond shaped, the eyes turn down slightly at the outside giving an impression of knowledge,
        wisdom, and insight; and also sheer eroticism. This lady is by no means a virgin, but few have dared to love her
        except from afar. Even her posture breathes sensuality and eroticism, unlike the mere sexiness of her younger
        neighbor. She is surrounded by many animals and she stands on a highly fertile plane filled with grains and ripe
        fruits and vegetables. As the oarsman rows on I begin to weep, as I do not wish to ever leave this Lady of
        Light. I start to sing a song to her . . .<div class="calibre20">

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Soon, as the boat moves on, I can see her no more.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I feel sad, like a part of me is missing now that she is not there.
        But this sadness doesn’t last long. Soon, another woman comes into view. She is much older, and at first glance
        her appearance is hag-like. But as I look at her I see a hidden sense of vitality, which shines from within her
        eyes. I see that she has lived a full and meaningful life. Even though her time grows short, she regrets not one
        day of her existence. In my mind I can almost see her beauty when she was young, and the exuberance that
        accompanied that youth. As I look at her, I see what I at first considered to be a hag-like appearance now has a
        beauty of its own. A beauty of time and experience. A beauty of age. She also has a sort of majesty about her,
        which gives her a beauty that transcends her physical appearance.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">We continue around the island, and I realize that what I have seen are
        the faces of the threefold lunar Goddess of Paganism. This is natural, since I have studied Wicca or Witchcraft
        for a long time. We finally return to the first spot where we came upon the island. I bid the oarsman to cease
        his labors and wait here for a few moments. He stops the boat.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In my heart I say, “Oh Diana, Goddess of the Moon and beyond, I beg
        that if you have a message for me that you will grant me thy favor and let me now receive it.” A beautiful
        figure approaches from somewhere on the island. She stands with one foot in the water and speaks to me. Although
        we are separated by about one hundred feet of water and she speaks quietly, I am able to hear her perfectly. She
        says: ____________________.</span></div>

          <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Okay, I admit it. I’m angry. For over fifteen years I was
              teaching classes on pathworking. I taught people how to do it and what they would experience. I led them
              on traditional path-workings up and around the Tree of Life. And lo, it was good.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Right now I am typing at my desk surrounded by glass-fronted
              barrister bookcases that are filled with occult books and manuscripts. In fact, if you visited my home you
              might be inclined to think that I lived in a library equipped with a bed. The point I’m making is simply
              that I’ve got a lot of books.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">For those of you who are also heavily involved in buying (and, I
              hope, reading) occult books, you may have noticed that over the past decade or so, several books have been
              published dealing with pathworking. They seem to make pathworking into a mythologized journey through any
              archetypal images in the imagination. I had experienced this type of visualized journey in numerous
              classes for many years, but it is only recently that it has begun to be called pathworking instead of
              “guided visualization.” I guess that phrase isn’t “sexy” enough.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Well, for a while, I got on a metaphoric soapbox, crying out
              that they were doing guided visualized journeys, not pathworking. Hey, you writers and teachers!
              Pathworking is a specific practice. It’s not what you’re teaching! I tried. I wrote articles. I gave
              workshops. But my message was met with blank stares and total apathy. Nobody cared that a word with a
              specific meaning was having its meaning destroyed.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Sometimes, as a result of popularization, words end up
              developing their own meanings. In fact, the new meanings may actually be contradictory to their original
              meanings. For some people, “That’s bad” now means “That’s good.”</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">My favorite example of this is the expression “quantum leap.” If
              you ask most people what this means, they’ll tell you it’s a giant step forward from the past. In
              actuality, quantum leap (or quantum jump) originally meant a tiny step (an electron unexpectedly changing
              instantaneously from one quantum state to another) where you could see a differentiation from what existed
              before. In both cases there can be something revolutionary as a result, but in the original it was caused
              by a tiny change and in the popular sense it was caused by an enormous change. So the expression can mean
              both tiny and large. How can you communicate when the same expression means opposite things to different
              people?</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Well, I discovered that trying to change people’s minds about
              this is like trying to hold back the ocean tides with a bucket that’s filled with holes. It’s just not
              going to happen. I decided to stop wasting my time fighting what is.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Therefore, in this lesson (and in my workshops and classes), if
              I use the term “pathworking” by itself, I’m talking about a guided visualized journey. When I’m discussing
              or teaching the ancient system of taking a journey up and around the Tree of Life, as I’m sharing with you
              in this lesson, I’ll call it “Kabalistic Pathworking.”</span></div>

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">She backs away, and I bid her farewell. Now the oarsman takes us back
        the way we came. I notice things that, in my excitement, I had not noticed on the trip out. I see at the dock
        where I met the boat-man a huge structure of rock, which forms the last Hebrew letter, Tav. I see distantly in
        the sky the planet Saturn, clearly discernible by its spectacular rings. As I walk back down the path by which I
        had come, I see trees of ash and yew, along with cypresses. Leaning against a yew I see a large sickle, and I
        get a small whiff of what smells like rotten eggs. Thankfully, the scent quickly dissipates. I walk back down
        the path until ahead I finally see the wreath and the four mystical creatures. I enter the wreath and
        immediately see my temple and its guardian. I walk into the temple and sit in the lap of my physical body. I
        open my eyes and say a silent prayer, thanking both Diana and my temple’s guardian. I once again perform the
        banishing rituals. When I look at a clock, I am surprised to see that only thirty-seven minutes have passed. It
        has seemed like several hours.</span></div>

        Sephiroht in the next part of the lesson. However, once again I urge you to wait for a few days or even a week
        and experiment with the simple methods of astral projection as presented so far. If you wish, you may even work
        with going into the last three cards of the Major Arcana and see what is on those paths, the three lower paths

        Also, notice the symbols mentioned at the end: Saturn, certain types of trees, a scythe, and the Hebrew letter
        Tav. These are all associated with the 32nd path, the path of the Tarot card “the Universe.” It is impossible
        for me to list all of the appropriate correspondences here. Besides, they have already been listed in the book
        <span class="italic">777</span> by Aleister Crowley, <span class="italic">Godwin’s Cabalistic
          Encyclopedia</span> by David Godwin, and <span class="italic">The Complete Magician’s Tables</span> by Stephen

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The way the Tarot fits onto the Tree of Life is, as you can see, very
        important. It is the key for moving from one Sephira to another. You should become familiar with the

    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">The purpose of Kabalistic Pathworking is primarily one of information
        gathering. By questioning higher spiritual entities it is possible to learn new rituals, new magickal
        techniques, and new mystical information. It is important to remind you that this information is for you and you
        alone. Although rituals so obtained may require others to help you in performing a ceremony, it might not be
        appropriate for anyone else in the universe to perform such rites for him- or herself.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This presents an opportunity to repeat Dion Fortune’s important point
        yet again: “There is no room for authority in occultism.” Merely because someone reports that he or she had
        success with an originally devised ritual does not mean anyone else will have success with it. Similarly, a
        great many books on supposedly occult topics are nothing more than the fantasies of the authors. I know of one
        book that has been through a great many printings and claims that the reason you can hear other people’s
        thoughts (clairaudience) is because when those people think of something they actually “speak” their thoughts
        through their ears! The idea makes perfect sense to the author, but it seems ridiculous to me. I know of another
        well-respected author who wrote a book concerning a lost civilization. The author made up the book and used his
        real name (with a “Dr.” added) for an important character. He also used his wife’s magickal name in the text.
        For the pseudonym listed as the author of the book, he switched around the letters of the words “not really” to
        make up a name! And this book was successful enough to warrant the publishers taking it into a second
        printing.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">But what I have talked about in the previous paragraph refers
        particularly to what you or anyone else might learn from higher spiritual entities as you work your way around
        the Tree of Life. What I want to share with you now is how you get to a location where you can meet those
        entities.</span></div>

        need to know that archangel’s name in order to enter. This is similar to the idea of having to give the name of
        a friend in order to get into a private club. In other words, the name of the archangel of a particular Sephira
        is the password for gaining admittance into that Sephira. Knowing the appropriate passwords (archangelic name
        associated with the Sephira) will allow you to enter any Sephira.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">First, with the help of the Talismanic Magick chart, decide what the
        purpose of the Kabalistic Pathworking is to be and which Sephira you are going to visit. As an example, let us
        say that we feel low on vitality and wish to increase our energy. The Sephira involved is Giburah, and it is to
        Giburah we must go. Next, as before any act of Grey Magick, do a divination to see what the probable outcome of
        the ritual will be. Let us assume that the divination indicates that the outcome would be very positive. The
        next step is to decide the proper time to do the ritual. Let’s choose the fourth Magickal Hour after sunset on a
        Thursday during the waxing of the Moon. This was determined from the table of Magickal Hours.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It may be that your purpose would be only to communicate with a higher
        spiritual entity and become “friendly” with that entity. In this case it is not really Grey Magick and does not
        require a divination. However, performing a divination first will indicate the probability of success and could
        save you a great deal of wasted time.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The next step is to prepare the area. It is a good idea to give the
        temple area a good cleansing. Dust, wash, vacuum&mdash;whatever is appropriate. Then, you must also have an
        altar and the magickal tools or weapons. These include the four elemental tools and the Rainbow Wand. You will
        also need a piece of black material, suitable for covering the pentacle. The material should preferably be made
        of silk, but natural fibers such as cotton or wool will suffice. Stay away from nylons and polyesters. Also
        needed is a “road map.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">A road map simply lists everything that you will need to know for the
        ritual. For this ritual we will need to know the correspondences for Yesode, Tiferet, and Giburah. We will also
        need to know the correspondences for the paths on the Tree of Life, which link these Sephiroht. This includes
        knowing the Tarot cards that are associated with the paths we are going to traverse. For this example the cards
        are the Universe, Temperance, and Justice. Make sure your writing is large enough and clear enough to be seen in
        a dimly lit room. Also, I prefer to use heavier cardstock rather than paper, as it holds its shape and is easier
        to control than flopping, thin paper.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Note that the path we are taking is from Mahlkoot (Sephira number 10)
        to Yesode (9), to Tiferet (6), to Giburah (5). We could have gone from Mahlkoot to Yesode to Hode (8) to
        Giburah, which would go up the Left Pillar. Or we could have chosen to go from Mahlkoot to Yesode to Netzach (7)
        to Tiferet to Giburah. This would be a longer way, but one which would still get us to the goal. In any event,
        for Grey Magick always begin by going first to Yesode from Mahlkoot. This is because Yesode is associated with
        magick. Since our example is Grey Magick, we first proceed to Yesode. Had the goal of the ritual simply been to
        gain knowledge and not ask for either a change in the physical world, or information that would allow us to
        create that change, we could have followed a path directly up the Left Pillar without first stopping at
        Yesode.</span></div>

        </span></span></h3>
    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Using the system described in earlier parts of this lesson, either
        mentally or astrally project out-of-body. Look around your temple until you find the Universe door. Enter the
        card as described and look for a path ahead of you. Will yourself to move along this path, which will move you
        up the Tree toward Yesode. Because your intention is different, your trip may be different from the one
        previously described.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Eventually you will come to a blocked door or pathway. There will be a
        guardian or several of them at this point. They are the Order of Angels associated with this Sephira. In the
        case of Yesode, they are the Kerubeem. To pass them and enter Yesode, use the password “Gabriel” (pronounced
        “Gahb-ree-ehl”), the Archangel of Yesode.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Once you are allowed to pass into this Sephira, look around and make
        sure that you are in Yesode (part of Step Four) by comparing what you see, smell, experience, etc., with the
        known correspondences for this Sephira. As an example, if you see elephants, you are in Yesode. However, if you
        see a hermaphrodite you have somehow gotten into Hode. If you run into any problems or uncertainties, simply go
        back the way you came.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Eventually you will come to a door (or perhaps a curtain or painting)
        that appears to be a huge version of the card Temperance. Project into this card and look for its largest and
        most apparent path. When you eventually see this path, begin to travel along it. Soon you will find a blocked
        door or gate or path or entry of some kind. It will be blocked by the Malacheem, the angels of the Sephira
        Tiferet. To pass, use the password “Raphael” (pronounced “Rah-fah-ehl” ) .</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In a similar way to Yesode, now get used to Tiferet. Make sure you are
        here by the use of correspondences. Next, look for the Tarot card Justice. Project into this card, look for the
        path, and move until your way is blocked. Here the guardians are the Serapheem and the password is “Khamael”
        (pronounced “Kah-mah-el”). Again, make sure you are in Giburah by correspondences and by Gematria.</span></div>
    <h3 class="calibre32"><span class="calibre33"><span class="italic1">
          <span class="italic1"><span class="bold1">STEP FOUR: Verifications</span></span>
        </span></span></h3>
    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">To verify that you are in the appropriate Sephira, you can use the
        correspondences as already described. However, an even better way to do the verifications is via Gematria. This
        can only be done if you come into contact with entities capable of communication. Ask who they are. Since you
        are above the lowest astral levels, you do not have to worry about the creatures here having egos and thus being
        liars. Spiritual creatures on these levels have no true will of their own and cannot lie, but they do not have
        to spell out their answers in plain language. They may test you.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">According to the Kabalah, Hebrew is the true language of the angels,
        and they may reply in Hebrew. On the next page you see a chart with the Hebrew letters. You will also see that
        each Hebrew letter is associated with a number. Therefore, each Hebrew word has a numerical value. Since 5 = 5,
        according to the Kabalah and Gematria, any Hebrew word whose letters equal a certain value is related to any
        other Hebrew word whose letters have that same total.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As an example of a test, perhaps when you think you are in Tiferet you
        might come upon an entity and you ask whom that entity is. The entity says, “Shavat.” This means “rod” in
        Hebrew, and the letters come to a total of 311. The number of Raphael is also 311. Therefore, you are in Tiferet
        and are before the Archangel Raphael. You have been tested by way of Gematria and know how to pass the test.
        <span class="italic">If you are unsure at any time, simply return the way you came.</span></span></div>

              letters. Notice that some English sounds and letters are not included. There is no “E.” Nor is there an
              “F,” although the Peh does have a “Ph” sound, which for all practical purposes equates with the “F.”
              Although the letter “A” is traditionally given as the sound for Aleph, the Aleph really has no sound. It
              is merely a placeholder for vowels, which in ancient days were understood and in modern Hebrew are
              indicated by points and lines written above, within, or below the letters when needed. The Koph is
              sometimes spelled “Qoph” and is said to be represented in English by the letter “Q.” However, it is always
              pronounced like a “K.” The “Ch” of the Chet is pronounced like the “ch” of the Scottish word
              “loch.”</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The third column contains the number value of each letter. Note
              that after 10 it goes to 20, 30, etc. Likewise, after 90 it goes to 100, 200, etc. Eleven is made by the
              combination Yud-Aleph or Aleph-Yud. Twenty-two is made by the combination Kaph-Bet or Bet-Kaph. Three
              hundred forty-seven is made by any combination of the letters Shin, Mem, and Zayin.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The second number, when it appears in column three, and the
              Hebrew in column four show the special enumeration and appearance of five letters known as “finals.” The
              letters in column four show how these letters look when they appear at the end of a word. Their values at
              the end of a word are given in column three, and follow the commas in that column.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Column five gives the name of each letter in transliteration.

        searching around for later Kabalistic Pathworking experiments.</span></div>

                    any and all spirits called by this rite return to their abodes and habitations, and harm none on thy

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Of course, the “grateful odor” is the incense that you have been
        burning. Thus, if you are alone, you would add some more incense to the burner at this time. As you probably
        realize, non-physical entities do not have noses and cannot “smell” incense. But by tradition spiritual entities
        supposedly enjoy the astral double of the incense.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Clap your hands together loudly three times. This helps bring you
        “down to earth” quite literally. Finish by doing the Closing by Watchtower. Make a record of the ritual in your

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If at any time you feel uncomfortable or “watched” or anything else
        which gives you an unpleasant feeling while performing this ritual, work your way down the Tree immediately and
        rejoin your physical body. Then, take the cover off the pentacle and, starting in the east, show it all around
        the circle while you move in a clockwise direction. Follow this by doing the usual closing. Then open all of the
        windows and air out the room. This will protect you from any unknown problems that might have developed as a
        result of performing this interrupted ritual. If you follow the instructions given, you have all of the help you
        need right at your fingertips.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This ritual also points the directions that you must study for the
        future. To successfully perform this ritual do you need to work on Gematria? On correspondences? On familiarity
        with the Tree of Life? On the Tarot? On astral projection? There are virtually months’ or even years’ worth of
        study and development ahead. By coming back to this lesson you will always know exactly what you need to study.
        You will always have a focus for future development.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">One of the things I like to say is that “the beginning of wisdom is
        the realization of ignorance.” You can’t know what you need to learn until you realize that you are ignorant in
        some area. With this ritual as a guide you will always know exactly what you need to study, exactly what you
        need to learn. And that will continue until you reach your ultimate goal, until you are no longer just a student
        of the magickal arts, but are indeed a true, successful, and accomplished magician.</span></div>

    <h2 class="calibre29"><span class="calibre30">
        <span class="bold1">From Ritual to Ceremony</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">There are two more considerations that need to be met concerning the
        previous ritual. One of these is how to perform the ritual as a ceremony&mdash;a group working. The other is how
        to find your personal temple’s guardian.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If you have reached a state where astral projection is either possible
        or even easy, you already have a guardian. Before I explain this I have to give a bit of background
        information.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">You may have read of organizations that claim to speed your psychic
        development or of exercises that can do this. No matter how many exercises you perform or organizations you
        join, you will not be able to project under the control of your will until you are ready to do so. A necessity
        for this is becoming totally aware of the physical plane. That is a reason why early in these lessons you were
        given exercises to develop your control of the elements, for the magickal elements are the very basis of the
        physical plane. Once you are aware of the ins and outs of the physical plane, you become ready to explore other
        areas and projection becomes simple&mdash;well, at least relatively so. Also, things start to “flow” more
        positively for you. This is in part due to your harmony and “friendship” with the archangel of the physical
        plane, Sandalphon.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As one function, Sandalphon oversees the “temples” of all astral
        travelers. Note that I put the word “temples” in quotation marks. This is because not everyone who projects has
        a clearly established temple. For most people who project, the temple is nothing more than the place from which
        they start. And most people have no map of the astral plane such as you have with the Tree of Life. Have you
        ever been lost in a big city with no map and no friends? It is no wonder that some of these people return from
        their astral wanderings with absurd tales of terror.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">What they see is nothing more than their own fears brought to astral
        life.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">For those people who are aware of the nature of the universe, such as
        I hope you are learning to be, astral travel becomes a fun and liberating experience. Guarding your temple and
        your physical body so that neither will come to harm on the physical plane is Sandalphon. The astral duplicate
        of your temple is protected by your banishing rituals.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Sandalphon is an archangel, and frequently does not do things “in
        person.” Rather, Sandalphon can send one or more members of the Order of Angels under “his” command (actually,
        angelic beings are genderless except for our convenience). Thus, rather than Sandalphon, your guardian may be
        one of the Asheem, the Angelic Order whose name means “Souls of Fire.” The next question is, “How do you find
        out this angel’s name?” The answer: Just ask!</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">When you project, you will see your guardian angel. Ask this being by
        what name it wishes to be called. Ask for the best way by which it can be called. Ask for any special rituals
        that can help in this. Sometimes, call your guardian just to “say hello” and give gifts of energy (see previous
        ritual) or incense. Build a bond and your guardian angel will never let you down. Don’t forget to thank
        Sandalphon for sending or assigning you this particular angel.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Changing the Ritual of the Paths to the Ceremony of the Paths is quite
        easy, but there is an important warning. For a final time in these lessons I repeat it. I’m sorry if you find
        this redundant, but I really want to urge you to begin thinking for yourself. Merely because someone said
        something doesn’t make it so. The best way to learn Kabalistic Pathworking is by doing it. I know of at least
        two “teachers” who advise not to try Kabalistic Pathworking unless you are under their supervision, and then all
        they do is lead you through some guided imagery. Real teachers can start you in this work, but you must do the
        work yourself. Nobody can do it for you.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">So, is a group working possible? Yes, but it may not be the same as
        what you have read or heard. The beginning is done much the same as any other ceremony, with the parts divided
        as has been suggested in past lessons. When this is finished, all must sit in a circle holding hands. This
        holding of hands is very important, as it links you together both physically and psychically. You must have
        decided beforehand to which Sephira you will all be going and by which paths. Everyone must go by the same
        directions.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If a member has trouble projecting, the physical and spiritual link
        within the circle will help that person achieve projection. Also, if one person is slower than the others, he or
        she will automatically be pulled ahead to keep up with the group. If one or more persons would exceed the speed
        of the group on their way up the Tree, they will be slowed down by being part of that group. This happens
        automatically. The path for each person will seem shorter or longer depending upon their natural speed in the
        astral plane and the average speed of the group.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Once the journey is complete and everyone is back in their respective
        bodies within the physical temple, a leader should ask each person what he or she experienced. This may be done
        orally or each person can write the experience down and the journals can be compared.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Listen and look for similarities. Differences should not be thought of
        in terms of being wrong. They are simply items that an observer experienced due to his or her personal
        psychological and magickal makeup. Information that is identical among several people should be considered
        important. Information that is similar between people should also be thought of as significant. The
        inconsistencies are simply personal variations on a basic reality.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">If this is a first time for a group working together, it may be beneficial to have one or
        more persons who are experienced with astral projection and Kabbalistic Pathworking as observers within the
        circle. The observer(s) can watch out for any unknown problems, and, if need be, summon everyone back by calling
        in a loud voice:<div class="calibre20">
          <blockquote class="calibre21">
            <div class="calibre19">
              <div class="calibre12"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">I summon all back from the Tree to their
                    home</span>
                  <br class="calibre5" /><span class="bold">in this magickal temple.</span>
                  <br class="calibre5" /><span class="bold">Come home now!</span></span></div>
            </div>
          </blockquote>
        </div>
        <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If you have a group leader, he or she should hold the Rainbow Wand if
        there is only one such Wand in the group. If everyone has such a Wand, each should be held between the clasped
        hands of the people in the circle. The fingers should primarily be on the band of color associated with the
        Sephira to which they are going.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If you have a member of the group who is functioning as an observer,
        he or she should keep the candles lit and the incense burning. When energy is to be sent to a higher spiritual
        entity, it can be the duty of this person or persons to raise and direct the energy. Thus, they may dance or run
        to raise the energy and then direct it up through the top of the Rainbow Wand while holding the appropriately
        colored band of the Wand. If sex is to be used as a means of raising energy, the sex magick may be performed by
        one or more couples who are not going on the pathworking rather than having to break the circle. Direction of
        the energy is again controlled by holding the Rainbow Wand as above.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Although I personally have not participated in such a ceremony, I have
        it from a student that if you have a group of people, only one person may choose to do the pathworking while the
        rest supply the raised and directed energy. This, it is claimed, can be very powerful magickally.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The point I am trying to make with this discussion of group workings
        is that within certain limitations (the schematic or order of the ritual), nothing is necessarily dictated or
        set. Feel free to experiment and see what works the best for you and your group.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">You may have noticed that as this course has progressed, instructions
        for rituals have become skimpier and more schematic in nature. I have tried to give you the forms and the
        background information so that you can fill in the details and make up your own rituals and ceremonies based on,
        and in harmony with, traditional Western ceremonial magick. At the same time, I have attempted to show you how
        to be original and thoughtful.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I have tried to give you the basics of Western ceremonial magick so
        that you can think, act, and be a magician. If I have done this and move you along the path of the Great Work,
        then I have succeeded.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Prefatory Comments:</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Modern Magick</span> has been an important part
        of my life. It took ten years for me to learn enough to teach these concepts and more years teaching and
        practicing before I put it into writing. And now, after being in print for over two decades, it is considered by
        many to be a “classic” and has sold more copies than any other book of its kind. I’ve been very fortunate and
        want to thank all of the people who have read and used earlier editions.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The first and second editions ended with Lesson Eleven. The reason is
        that with those lessons it is possible to achieve any magickal goal and learn any magickal system. <span
          class="italic">Modern Magick</span> is not the alpha and omega of magick, but it does give you the tools so
        you can discover your own magickal alpha and omega. There quite literally was nothing more to give you because
        the goal was to let you move ahead on your own. Since the initial publication of these lessons, nothing has
        changed in that regard.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">However, there are new technologies and new paradigms of magick that
        have appeared. In fact, there have been a surprising number of such new technologies and theories as to how
        magick works. Several authors have written books claiming that their understanding explains all of magick and
        makes it easy. You may not be familiar with those books because they have come and gone. I believe the reason
        they vanished is because the authors failed to understand that magick is both a science and an art. Their
        revelations were simply personal artistic interpretations of magick and the authors confused it with the
        science. They made the error in formal logic of going from the specific to the general (“What works for me must
        work for everyone”) without any reason for doing so. This error, unfortunately, is made in many fields of
        endeavor.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Unless you have some desire to do so, there is no need to learn those
        neo-magickal systems. Quite frankly, in <span class="italic">Modern Magick</span> you have everything you need
        either as a self-contained magickal system or as the basis for understanding other systems. Besides, they may be
        hard to find, as most of those other systems vanished with their founders. However, the title of this volume
        indicates that this course of lessons is “modern,” and it would be remiss of me not to include new systems that
        have either stood a test of time or could possibly be the direction that magick in the future is headed.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Therefore, I have added this new chapter for the third edition of
        these lessons. I think that in some ways nature has directed me to do this, as I always felt that eleven lessons
        (even though in numerology eleven is a “master number”) wasn’t right and there should be twelve, matching the
        months of the year, the signs of the zodiac, etc.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">So what are the systems that will be covered here? The first one I’ll
        be sharing is one aspect of the system known as Neuro-Linguistic Programming, or NLP. The original books that
        were written on the subject by the founders of the system were titled <span class="italic">The Structure of
          Magic</span> (Volumes I and II), so it’s clear that they considered the ease at making changes in your life
        and the lives of others virtually magickal in nature. One website I read even defines NLP as a science and an
        art, just like our definition of magick.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Today, there are many people who have heard a bit about
        Neuro-Linguistic Programming but don’t know much about it. Most people who are NLP IROBs (“I Read One Book [and
        now I’m an expert!]”) or who have seen entertainers who <span class="italic">claim</span> to use NLP (often
        misleadingly so) think that NLP is a set of techniques that can be used to manipulate people against their
        wills. In fact, an entire industry has developed that claims to teach men how to seduce unwilling women using
        Neuro-Linguistic Programming. When you actually look at the methods of the PUA (pick-up artist) industry you see
        that they don’t really use anything but the most superficial levels of NLP and, in fact, teach that picking up
        women is simply a “numbers game” (the more women you try to pick up, the more likely you are to succeed with
        one) and give encouragement and self-assurance techniques. These methods have been taught under different names
        for at least eighty years.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Many of those people who actually are trained and certified in
        Neuro-Linguistic Programming tend to think of it in terms of being some form of therapy. Indeed, the techniques
        of NLP can be used for eliminating the effects of limiting beliefs and decisions, as well as quickly ending
        problems that in the past took months or years to only create minor improvements in behaviors.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">But NLP is much more. Perhaps a simple definition of NLP would be “a
        set of techniques for modeling excellence.” A basic belief is that if someone else can do something, and if you
        can model or duplicate their way of behaving and thinking, you can accomplish it, too. For example, although I
        studied martial arts years ago, I did not achieve a level where students produced some of the phenomena that
        have made certain forms of martial arts so dramatic. And yet, with no further martial arts practice or training,
        after about two weeks of training in NLP I was able to use my open palm to break a solid wooden board, twelve
        inches to a side and one inch thick, with a single blow. My fellow students in the workshop were all able to
        accomplish this feat, too. We did it by modeling someone who was trained in the practice and knowing that if he
        could accomplish it, so could we. I still have the broken board as proof of my training.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Just as it is impossible to cover all aspects of magick in one book,
        it is also impossible to cover all aspects of Neuro-Linguistic Programming in part of one lesson in a course of
        lessons. NLP can be used to help improve writing; enhance public speaking abilities; increase sales; improve
        relationships; help settle disagreements; overcome phobias, bad habits, and unwanted behaviors; and much more.
        It covers too wide of an area, and besides, NLP is actually intended to be installed though in-person trainings,
        not taught in books. I know there are books and DVD courses that claim to teach you NLP, but in reality all they
        do is teach you <span class="italic">about</span> NLP. To really use it requires being trained by a qualified
        instructor, as much of the training occurs on an unconscious level. The skill to do this is installed in
        certified trainers. Be that as it may, I believe I can adequately teach one aspect of NLP, and you can learn it.
        It is a form of mental magick that allows you to create whatever you want in your future. It’s powerful, simple,
        and direct.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The second system I’ll be describing in this lesson may be the most
        popular neo-magickal paradigm today: Chaos Magick. I have been studying and practicing this system of magick
        even before it received that name. I still have the first book on the subject, <span class="italic">Liber
          Null</span>, which I had to order from a small shop in the U.K. This was published a decade before the U.S.
        edition (which was combined with another book, <span class="italic">Psychonaut</span>) was printed. In 1990 I
        wrote articles for a small, early U.S. journal, “Thanateros,” which was focused on Chaos Magick.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There are some problems with writing about Chaos Magick because, as
        one of the most popular expressions in Chaos Magick goes: “Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.” This
        expression is attributed to Hassan-i Sabbah, the founder of an Islamic mystery cult that smoked hashish and
        allegedly committed murders to further their cause. They were known as the <span
          class="italic">Hasheeshin</span>, and that name is the source of our word “assassin.” The quotation was used
        by Friedrich Nietzsche in his classic book, <span class="italic">Thus Spake Zarathustra</span>. Nietzsche is one
        of the influences of Chaos Magick. The expression means that since everything we know of the outside world comes
        through our limited senses, there can be no objective truth. Therefore, everything is true and possible. That
        makes Chaos Magick filled with incredible possibilities. Unfortunately, it also means that some people think
        their way is <span class="italic">the</span> way and only way. So whatever I write, I’m sure, will get me in
        trouble with someone. But that’s okay. Read and practice the techniques in this section and decide for
        yourself.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Finally, the third system I’m going to be sharing is one that has
        thoroughly attracted my attention. This is the interpretation of magick presented by author Patrick Dunn in his
        two books (as of this writing), <span class="italic">Postmodern Magic</span> and <span class="italic">Magic,
          Power, Language, Symbol</span>. This system relates the very essence of magick to language (linguistics) and
        symbol (semiotics). It a modern understanding of the way the mind and even computers work. Can you see where
        this is evolving? In my view, Dunn’s vision of magick actually unites concepts of NLP (with its focus on using
        language effectively) and Chaos Magick (with its practice of using symbols effectively) into a system that is
        ideal for the twenty-first century. He turns age-old beliefs on their head and presents new ways of looking at
        magick. Of all the systems I’ve seen, this one&mdash;if it catches on&mdash;is the most ideal for the
        iPod-listening, online-game-playing, computerphillic generation that will be leading the world for generations
        to come.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The first edition of <span class="italic">Modern Magick</span> had
        many firsts, and if the third edition helps drive people to learn more about Neuro-Linguistic Programming, Chaos
        Magick, and Postmodern Magick, then the title of these lessons will remain accurate for generations of magickal
        students to come.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Although many people&mdash;especially “NLPers” (pronounced
        “nehl-pers”), people trained in and very enthusiastic about the value of NLP&mdash;will say that the concepts
        behind NLP as well as its many techniques are new, I have to disagree. I had learned many of the methods and
        ideas years before Neuro-Linguistic Programming was codified, and I’m sure they were around long before I
        learned them. What is new is the way they are presented and grouped, as well as the terminology used to separate
        NLPers from non-NLPers.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">For example, if someone sees something as negative, often they are so involved with the
        situation that they can’t see it in any way other than negative. By just presenting that person with a new way
        of interpreting things, it can literally change that person’s life:<div class="calibre20">

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I had always called that “looking at things in a different light.”
        Some people refer to that as “making lemonade when given lemons.” NLPers call it “reframing.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The things that makes NLP special, in my opinion, are not the concepts
        and techniques, but the grouping of them into a whole. These groupings and they way they’re used have a
        symbiotic effect&mdash;the result is greater than the sum of its individual parts.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As an example of this, let’s look at time. Many cultures see time in a
        cyclical pattern. Modern Western cultures generally view time as linear. That is, we see time as moving in a
        straight line from the past, through the present, and going into the future. More than that, we each have a
        concept of personal time: Event A happened in our past, we are experiencing Event B now, and if things keep
        going along the same path, it is likely that Event C will happen in the future. Mapping out certain events over
        time is something that is common to history books all over the world. It is known as a <span
          class="italic">timeline</span>.</span></div>
    <h2 class="calibre29"><span class="calibre30">
        <span class="bold1">Discovering Your Timeline</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">While it is easily possible to map out events over time, it is
        interesting to note that we each have a personal timeline. Even though we don’t constantly think about it, when
        asked we can see our lives as a linear series of events. Interestingly, this is not merely philosophical. There
        is actually a physical location to our personal concept of time. The first exercise in this lesson is the
        discovery of your personal timeline.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP ONE</span>. Think of a happy event from five
        years ago. Now, going with your first thought, point to where you hold that memory. It may be to your left or
        right, above or below you, in front of you or behind you. There is no right or wrong here, it’s just a location.
        If you can’t quickly determine where that past event is located in space, try to locate another event earlier in
        time, perhaps your birthday party from when you were five years old. If, after a few tries, you cannot locate a
        past event in space, ask yourself, “If I could locate this past event in space, where would it be?” Point to it
        quickly. Go with your first thought.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP TWO</span>. Now imagine something taking
        place in the future. Going with your first thought, point to where you think it will be. If this doesn’t come
        quickly and easily, try a different event you hope will occur in your future. If its spatial location still
        doesn’t come quickly and easily, ask yourself, “If I could locate this future event in space, where would it
        be?” Again, point to it quickly. Go with your first thought.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP THREE</span>. Imagine a line going from that
        past point in space to the future point in space. This is your personal timeline.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Notes</span>: For most people, the line is
        straight. It may go from right to left or left to right. It may go from your front to your back or vice versa.
        The present may be within you. That is, you may see the past behind you, the present going through part of your
        body, and the future being ahead of you. This may be on a diagonal. It may go from a lower height (relative to
        your body) in the past to a greater height in the future. Others may discover that the entire timeline is
        outside of them. They can see it in front of them or turn to see it behind them, running from side to side. Or
        perhaps it runs along either of your sides, going from back to front or front to back, but never touches
        you.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There is no right or wrong position for your personal timeline.
        Wherever it is located is perfect for you. If it doesn’t feel “right” to you, try locating some more points of
        past events and future events. You may find that your timeline is a curve or a “V” shape. For some people it may
        be wavy. It doesn’t matter. We’re just finding out the location of your timeline.</span></div>
    <h2 class="calibre29"><span class="calibre30">
        <span class="bold1">Location, Location, Location</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">If we look at the shape and location of different people’s timelines
        we can see lots of differences. There are two major grouping factors. For some people, their timeline is
        completely outside of their bodies. They can see the entire line&mdash;past, present, and future&mdash;to their
        sides, in front or behind them, above or below them, etc. At no time does this imagined timeline go through
        their bodies. Most often, however, the timeline for people in this group forms a line in front of them, going
        from left to right.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">To be a member of the second group, the timeline goes right through
        you with the present being within you. My personal timeline goes from a past that is below the center of my
        back, to a present that is within me at my heart, and on to a future that extends up and ahead of me. The most
        common form of timeline is like this, going from back to front with the present being within the body, but
        unlike my timeline it is level.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Are you in group one, where you can see the entirety of your timeline,
        or group two, where part of your timeline goes right through you? Both are fine. Neither is better than the
        other. But here’s a surprise: you can do a psychological analysis based just on whether a person is a type one
        or type two!</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">If you experience your timeline as completely outside of you, NLP describes you as being a

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It’s important, however, not to think dogmatically. While learning

    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">The timeline is not something that is static and simply there. It can
        be used as a powerful tool for magick and change. In order to use it, however, you’ll need to learn how to work
        with your timeline, a learning that will be the basis of the magick in this section. Working with your timeline
        is the purpose of the next exercise:</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP ONE</span>. Perform the Relaxation
        Ritual.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP TWO</span>. Imagine yourself floating above
        your body and high enough so you can see your timeline either next to your body or running through your body.
        Just observe. Stay in this position for a few moments.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP THREE</span>. Imagine yourself floating
        higher and higher, so that the timeline is only an inch long. Stay in this position for a few moments.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP FOUR</span>. Float down until you are just
        above the timeline and it stretches far into the distance to the past and the future. If you can see either end
        of the timeline, imagine the scale of the timeline changing so that it has more detail and you can no longer see
        either end. Stay in this position for a few moments.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP FIVE</span>. Think of a time in the past
        that has a pleasant memory. Perhaps it was a birthday, a prom, or your first date. Make sure it is a <span
          class="italic">pleasant</span> memory. Float back over your timeline until you are above that point in time
        and look down at it.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This is important: for this exercise <span class="italic">you should
          be an observer</span>. You should be able to see yourself having a great time within that memory. Technically,
        this is known as a dissociated memory. If you start experiencing the memory as if you are in it (technically
        known as an associated memory), immediately float up above the timeline so you are an observer and return to the
        present. It is important that in this step you are an observer only, not a participant.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP SIX</span>. After you have observed the
        pleasant past memory for a few moments, return to the present. Allow your consciousness to float back down and
        rejoin your body. Take some deep breaths. If you feel disconnected, walk around in a circle stomping your feet
        on the ground to bring yourself back to your normal consciousness.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As I stated in the prefatory comments, the technique you’re going to
        learn is a form of mental magick. It requires no wands or robes and no complex rituals. What you have learned in
        the exercise above are all of the basic techniques necessary to work with your timeline and do magick.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">You may wonder if this entire timeline concept is merely subjective
        and nothing but a metaphor with no basis in objective reality. Frankly, I don’t know if it’s objectively real,
        but I do know that it’s easy to prove that it functions in a very real way. The easiest way to prove this is by
        changing your timeline from In Time to Through Time, or the opposite way around. This changes the way you
        approach life and time and will make you feel uncomfortable or perhaps just really weird. If it were not real,
        how could it do this? Experiencing this change is a great way to learn about the reality of the timeline. It’s
        the purpose of the next exercise.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">It is not “better” to be an In Time person or Through Time person.
        Those are just terms to define how you process time on both a conscious and unconscious level. They are
        descriptions, not qualifiers. The advantage of knowing whether someone is an In Time or Through Time person is
        that it allows you to communicate with them better. The advantage of knowing whether you are an In Time or
        Through Time person is that it allows you to understand how you function in relation to time.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In my experience, these understandings are very real. Perhaps the best
        way to discover the reality of these two ways of processing time is by experiencing how the other half
        lives.</span></div>

          <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">In this lesson the terms “float” and “observe” are meant to be
              taken in the widest possible sense. For example, the term “float” could mean that you should get the
              feeling of floating on an air mattress on the surface of a pool, floating like a leaf on a gentle breeze,
              floating with your only support being a fluffy cloud, or floating like a waft of smoke from a cigarette
              through the currents of air. However you choose to actualize the concept of floating above yourself and
              your timeline, whatever feelings you get and however you do it, is perfect. There is no single correct way
              to be floating.</span></div>

          <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Similarly, don’t take the term “observe” to only mean a visual
              sense. Observing in these exercises can be done with any and all of your senses. You may use your hearing
              or feeling (sensing) as well as your visual sense. We actually use all of our senses when we observe
              something, so don’t let your limiting beliefs result in a limiting decision that prevents you from easily
              and effectively working magick with your timeline.</span></div>

      </blockquote>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I want to repeat that the experience of changing your timeline can be
        very disconcerting. Therefore, I urge that you do not, under any circumstances, allow this change to stay in
        effect for more than a day. When you first try this you may not want to allow the change to stay in place for
        more than a few minutes or a few hours. When I first did this I literally felt dizzy. However, nothing will let
        you see the reality of the timeline better than this experience.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP TWO.</span> Allow yourself to float up until
        you can see yourself and your timeline. Make sure you float high enough that you can observe the entire length
        of your timeline and see both ends. Pay close attention to this position of your timeline so you can return it
        to this position at a later time.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP THREE</span>. Using your imagination, allow
        your timeline to rotate. That is, if it’s going left to right, allow it to rotate so it is going back to front.
        If it’s going back to front, allow it to rotate so it is going from left to right or right to left. Most
        importantly, if it is going through you, when you rotate the timeline allow it to be completely outside of you.
        If the timeline is normally completely outside of you, when you rotate it allow it to run through you.</span>

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP FOUR</span>. Float down into the present,
        right into yourself, and allow your timeline to organize time according to its new position. You don’t have to
        “do” anything else. The new position will allow this reorganization to occur naturally.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP SEVEN</span>. Spend some time doing ordinary
        things and observe the way you feel. You have switched from being In Time to being Through Time, or vice
        versa.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Be sure to repeat this exercise and return your
          timeline to its original position</span>.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Besides proving the reality of the timeline and the concept of being
        In Time or Through Time, there can also be a practical use for changing your timeline. A person who is In Time
        is not as good at planning things as is a person who is Through Time. If you are an In Time person and need to
        plan an important meeting or party, you might want to temporarily change the direction of your timeline for this
        purpose. A person who is Through Time may have more difficulty in getting over past occurrences and dwell in
        anger over events that happened years ago. By switching to being an In Time person this person may be able to
        make positive breakthroughs in his or her life and move on before switching back to their normal Through Time
        approach.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">By the way, for further information on the differences between In Time
        and Through Time, you might look at Carl Jung’s book <span class="italic">Psychological Types</span>. An In Time
        person compares to Jung’s concept of the “Judger,” while a Through Time person relates to his idea of the
        “Perceiver.”</span></div>

    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">The previous two exercises, along with the information presented, has
        allowed you to understand the concept of the timeline, work with it, experience the reality of the concept and
        see how it effects you. The next step is to learn how to work with the timeline to create a desired change in
        your life. That is, this next part of the lesson will show you how to use the timeline to achieve a desire or
        goal.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">Many of the concepts presented here can be directly related to your other Grey Magick
        practices. For example, I’ve already described how the goals of your practical magick should be SMART goals. By
        that I mean they should be specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and have a time frame. I’ve also
        suggested that they should be ecological&mdash;good for you, good for those around you, and good for the planet.
        Let’s look at some other keys to making successful goals:<div class="calibre24">
          <div class="calibre25">
            <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">1. Your goal should be what you want, not what you
                don’t want. If your goal is vibrant health, describe it in a concrete and specific form: “I want to be
                able to run a marathon, be able to bench press 150 pounds, and fit into size 32 pants.” That’s specific
                and positive, as opposed to something like “I don’t want to be sick and I want to be stronger.”</span>

          <div class="calibre25">
            <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">2. You should know your present situation in comparison
                to your goal. This will allow your unconscious mind to design a map to achieve your goal. Picture
                yourself in the present situation. What does it feel and sound like?</span></blockquote>

          <div class="calibre25">
            <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">3. Determine how you will know when you have achieved
                your goal. One way to do this is by using the “last step” model. This is by concretely knowing exactly
                what is the last thing that has to happen for you to know you have achieved your goal. In the example
                given above, the last thing may be crossing the finish line of a marathon or slipping easily and
                comfortably into a pair of pants that is the desired size.</span></blockquote>

          <div class="calibre25">
            <blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre7">4. Make sure that your goal is only dependent upon you.
                You can’t change other people&mdash;only they can do that. You can, however, change yourself. Therefore
                your goals should not be dependent upon others. “I’ll be happy when I’m popular” not only isn’t very
                specific (what is popularity?), but it depends upon other people liking you. Instead, goals should be
                things that are entirely based on what you can achieve. “I’ll know I have achieved my goal when I finish
                a marathon” doesn’t require the help of anyone else.</span></blockquote>

                          realized that he might have uncovered the secret. He was transcribing recorded therapy
                          sessions of the famed Fritz Perls and noticed that patients were more likely to accept
                          suggestions from Perls when the therapist used certain words and patterns. Could that be the
                          key to Perls’ success?</span></div>
                      <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Bandler got in touch with linguistics instructor
                          John Grinder. Together, they analyzed the work of another psychiatrist, Virginia Satir. The
                          results of their work became the book <span class="italic">The Structure of Magic</span>,
                          published in 1975. As a result of their work they ended up meeting and modeling Dr. Milton
                          Erickson, a man who revolutionized the approach of psychologists to their patients and
                          legitimatized the use of hypnosis as a therapeutic tool.</span></div>

                          because it used language, and “programming” because computer programming was an up-and-coming
                          field&mdash;was being hailed as a great advance in the fields of counseling and psychology.
                          However, due to disagreements between the two founders, and the failure of anyone to trademark
                          or register the name, many people started to add concepts to an ever-broadening field. NLP
                          expanded to be used for such things as resolving business conflicts, improving sales
                          abilities, personal growth, enhanced communication skills, and much more.</span></div>

                          has caused questioning over its legitimacy. People are so busy using its techniques (and
                          making money from it) that thorough scientific testing of the many techniques used by NLP
                          practitioners has never been done. Still, practitioners can attest to its success with
                          innumerable anecdotal stories and evidence.</span></div>
                      <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The creators of NLP have clearly stated that it has
                          been designed so that people need to be trained in its use. Certified trainers of NLP will
                          explain that they have learned how to embed various aspects of NLP in the unconscious minds of
                          students taking the trainings. This comes from the way the material is presented during the
                          trainings combined with the use of certain words, word patterns, the tone of voice,
                          inflections, etc. None of this can ever be done through a book.</span></div>
                      <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Still, people will try to learn through books. Some
                          people who may have had some training (or who read some books) will try to share NLP ideas,
                          although without the depth and fullness that a real training includes.</span></div>

                          perhaps helping others by using NLP, I would strongly urge you to consider taking an actual,
                          in-person training. In the meantime, the many books and DVDs available on NLP will teach you a
                          great deal about the techniques and technology of achieving excellence.</span></div>

        simple and easy. But that doesn’t mean it’s not powerful and effective.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As mentioned previously, one of the people modeled by the founders of
        NLP was psychiatrist and hypnotherapist Dr. Milton Erickson. If you want to learn Erickson’s techniques from
        Ericksonians, you must spend months or years studying through observation of what Erickson was doing. You should
        also have training in psychology or psychiatry and already be a professional in that field. With NLP you can
        learn the basics of all the techniques of Erickson, known as the “Milton Model,” in a few hours. It may take
        much longer to be able to quickly put all of those techniques into practice and be able to effectively use them,
        but NLPers believe it can be done.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">What happens is that people discover something in their own way and
        add ideas, concepts, and techniques to “make it their own” even though these additions may have nothing to do
        with the effectiveness of the discovery. So it could be claimed that the NLP Milton Model includes only the
        essential aspects of Erickson’s techniques. It strips away all of the excesses that really aren’t needed.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This aggregation of non-essentials exists in many fields, not just
        those that have been stripped to their core by NLP. Many would claim that this has occurred in the area of
        traditional ceremonial magick, too. So what would happen if you could strip away all of the aggregated
        non-essentials in magick and limit yourself to only those things that are really necessary to magick, resulting
        in a system that focuses on results? Some people claim that has been done, and it’s called Chaos Magick.</span>

    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">As I mentioned earlier in this lesson, it’s difficult to pin down
        exactly what Chaos Magick is and isn’t simply because it has no hard and fast rules, no <span
          class="italic">Tome of Wisdom</span> ®™© passed down for hundreds of years that have becomes tombs of dogma
        limiting what can and cannot be done. In an article for <span class="italic">The Llewellyn Journal</span>,
        Andrieh Vitimus answers the question of what Chaos Magick is by saying that “possibly no two chaos magicians
        would agree” on an answer.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As is often the case, a good way to look for answers is to look for
        beginnings. To really understand the system it would help to understand the milieu in which it developed. One of
        the most important elements was . . . punk rock.</span></div>
    <h2 class="calibre29"><span class="calibre30">
        <span class="bold1">An Incomplete History of Chaos Magick</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">It was the middle 1970s. The war in Viet Nam had finally ended. The
        music world was filled with brilliant musicians, often playing elaborate, stylized music that was much more for
        the mind than it was for the heart, soul, or beat. Don’t get me wrong, I still like what has come to be called
        “progressive” rock (“prog-rock”) or “orchestral” rock. The problem with it was that you had to be an expert to
        play it and it often lost its core&mdash;it didn’t encourage listeners to get up and dance. Young people didn’t
        have music to dance to nonstop nor a major political cause to use up their energy. Something had to come up. A
        revolt had to brew. The industry knew it and promoted . . . disco. Disco wiped out numerous music venues that
        had previously played live music. Plus, kids saw their parents and grandparents dancing to disco. Yuck! This
        wasn’t their music; it was the music of corporate America. A revolt still lurked. That revolt manifested as punk
        rock.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The musicians weren’t great. The singing wasn’t always on key. It
        didn’t have elaborate musical structure or harmonies. But it had power, energy, and a nasty attitude. It changed
        rock music and what people were doing. It made musicians look at themselves and ask if they needed all of those
        keyboards and effect pedals and massive drum kits.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">By this time, the world of magick had become fairly solid. Ceremonial
        magicians were actually doing magick. People such as Chic and Sandra Tabatha Cicero and Patricia Monocris, under
        the guidance of Israel Regardie, were working the Golden Dawn system and running legitimate Golden Dawn temples,
        although schisms, the bane of many established groups, would eventually develop. Meanwhile, Wicca was becoming a
        strong tradition and recognized as a religion. Sectarianism, the bane of many religions, would begin to develop
        and this, combined with Wicca’s very success, would eventually lead to the explosive growth of solitary
        Wicca.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It was amid this environment that Peter J. Carroll and Ray Sherwin had
        a meeting. I have no idea what exactly was discussed there, but I’m going to assume that they asked questions
        similar to those of the punk rock musicians: Is religion (Wicca) necessary for magick? Is a belief in gods and
        goddesses necessary for magick? Are all of the complex robes and wands and rituals necessary for magick? If not,
        what <span class="italic">is</span> necessary?</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Two years later, Carroll and Sherwin formed a new magickal order, the
        Illuminates of Thanateros (IOT), and Sherwin published Carroll’s <span class="italic">Liber Null</span> and his
        own <span class="italic">The Book of Results</span>. <span class="italic">Liber Null</span> presented many of
        the basic theories for Chaos Magick (a term coined by Carroll) and Sherwin’s book gave a practical approach to
        its use based in part on the use of sigils as described by Austin Osman Spare and described elsewhere in these
        lessons. The IOT allowed the system to grow and evolve within a magickal order. Everything was in place except
        for one thing.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Wicca had started in England, but exploded in popularity in the U.S.A.
        Punk rock started in England and took over the music world there. Here in the U.S., the music world was
        controlled to a far greater extent by the corporations, so punk really only caught on in larger cities where
        live music was still being played. Chaos Magick also started in England, but without the support of American
        publishers of books, magazines, and journals, it wasn’t developing in the U.S. at all. A full decade went by
        before the first book on Chaos Magick was published in the U.S. Magazines with information on Chaos Magick were
        almost entirely British. Very little was getting over to the U.S. (this was pre-Internet), and just as punk rock
        appealed to younger people, such was also the case for much of Chaos Magick in the U.S.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There is a saying in various arts such as painting and music that you
        must learn the rules in order to break them. There is no doubt in my mind that the originators of Chaos Magick
        were (and are!) expert and experienced magicians. While there were certainly some people like that in the U.S.
        who were involved with Chaos Magick, many, perhaps most, were not. In fact, many were young boys with the
        attitude of “You mean I don’t have to study or practice and I can be a magician? Woo-hoo!” In fact, to be
        successful with Chaos Magick, as with any form of magick, requires study and practice, but saying this to some
        of the early U.S. “Chaotes” (practitioners of Chaos Magick; some Chaotes dislike the term, preferring “Chaoist”)
        resulted in disdainful “You’re just an old fogey” responses.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I once got into an online debate with a self-professed Chaote who said
        that (contrary to the importance of results as put forward by Sherwin) the important aspect of magick was simply
        doing it and that it didn’t matter if you got any results. I replied that if it didn’t matter whether you
        actually got any results, why not just sit back, do nothing, and merely claim you had done magick since the
        results&mdash;or lack thereof&mdash;would be the same. He responded that I just didn’t get it and he would no
        longer correspond. Well, maybe he was right, but here’s what I do get:</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Although Carroll and Sherwin can be considered the fathers of Chaos
        Magick&mdash;and perhaps more credit goes to Carroll because he’s had more published&mdash;the grandfathers are
        certainly Spare and Crowley. Since Crowley was heavily influenced by his training with the Golden Dawn, it could
        certainly be said that Chaos Magick is an offshoot (or an evolution) of traditional magickal practices. However,
        they were not the only influences.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The writings of Robert Anton Wilson were also an influence, as were
        those of Ramsey Dukes. The ideas of Discordianism and its “don’t take life too seriously” attitude play a part,
        as do the writings of Dr. Timothy Leary. Shamanism influenced Chaos Magick, as did the (then) new science of
        chaos theory, quantum physics, and science fiction.</span></div>
    <h2 class="calibre29"><span class="calibre30">
        <span class="bold1">What Does Chaos Have to Do with It?</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">I’ve already mentioned one of the basic concepts of Chaos Magick, that
        “Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.” This is based on the concept that everything we perceive comes
        through our senses and is therefore subjective, not objective, reality. We can easily change our subjective
        reality, so we can achieve anything we want; we can successfully work magick.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">But if this is a basic belief, a tenet of Chaos Magick, how is it
        chaotic? The answer is actually rather simple. At the time Chaos Magick was being originated, chaos science was
        also developing and was a fascinating subject. It would be easy to say that Carroll just took the name because
        it was popular, but there’s more to it than that.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">One of the consistent questions of magick is “Where does the power of
        magick originate?” Over time, the answer to that question has changed. Anciently, it was with the gods and
        goddesses. Over time it became spirits and for many it was a manifestation of our inner power. According to
        chaos science, before the universe formed, there was only chaos. Carroll suggested that since this chaos was the
        source of everything in the universe, it must also be the source of the energy used for magick. Thus, Chaos
        Magick wasn’t so named because it is chaotic, but because it taps into the primal source of energy, which is
        pure chaos.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Personally, I think this is simply renaming God or the gods and
        calling them “chaos.” It’s a different name for the same thing (please put away your torches and
        pitchforks!).</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This brings up another popular Chaos Magick concept: there are no gods
        and goddesses, or if there are, they’re not involved with us. What we call gods are simply manifestations of our
        own minds. However, for doing magick, the concept of gods can be very effective. Therefore, we can use any gods
        from any pantheon and pretend they are real until they develop a subjective reality for us. That is, you “fake
        it ’till you make it.” Personally, I think that’s an awful lot of work just to follow the dogma of “There are no
        deities but pretend they’re there ’cause it’s useful.” Either don’t work with deities or use them. But that’s
        just me.</span></div>
    <h2 class="calibre29"><span class="calibre30">
        <span class="bold1">Other Chaos Magick Concepts</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">One of the important concepts of Chaos Magick has its origins in a
        combination of two concepts: results are what matters and everything is permitted. Thus, a practitioner of Chaos
        Magick is likely to work with any appropriate deities from any pantheon in one ritual. A ritual might involve an
        ancient Sumerian deity, a Voudoun Loa, and an Old One from H. P. Lovecraft’s fictional Cthulhu mythos. Of
        course, they’re only representations of concepts and energies, and they’re not objectively real, but they make
        great metaphors to direct the energy and the ritual. Cross-cultural adoptions are fine, and you can just pretend
        they’re real and fake it ’till you make it.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In fact, a practitioner might go one step further, doing what is
        called <span class="italic">paradigm shifting</span>. Take a deity from one pantheon and include that deity in a
        ritual from a completely different paradigm. This paradigm shifting can have a powerful effect on a
        practitioner, opening him or her up to potentials that are not limited to their normal worldview. It can
        literally shake things up and break down limiting beliefs.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">A Chaote might even go back further, borrowing from shamanic practices
        to induce an altered state of consciousness called <span class="italic">gnosis</span>. Those of you reading this
        who are familiar with various gnostic concepts but are not familiar with Chaos Magick concepts might be
        unfamiliar with the use of the term “gnostic” in this sense. This altered state, also known as a Gnostic Trance,
        is based on becoming totally focused on one thing. The use of extreme focus induces a trance state. Often the
        focus of such a trance is a sigil designed in a fashion similar to the system of Austin Osman Spare. There are
        many methods for achieving the Gnostic State and Chaotes will often come up with their own method for achieving
        it. There is no limitation placed on the technology for achieving Gnosis.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As described previously in these lessons, the goal is to focus the
        energy (in this case by achieving the Gnostic Trance) and then forgetting what you are doing. This has the
        effect of sending the purpose of the ritual (as made concrete through a sigil), combined with energy to manifest
        it, directly to the unconscious mind (rather than the conscious). The unconscious mind puts everything into
        action, bringing to bear whatever is needed to bring about the goal. This is true even if you don’t know what
        the goal is.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Huh?</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Some Chaos magicians will make up a bunch of sigils for various
        purposes and put them aside. After a while, the conscious mind won’t remember the purpose of the sigil. Still, a
        ritual can be performed to achieve the goal as indicated by the sigil. This makes even more important the old
        saying “Be careful what you wish for. You just might get it.”</span></div>
    <h2 class="calibre29"><span class="calibre30">
        <span class="bold1">Who Are You?</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">“Who are you?” is the question posed by the caterpillar to Alice
        during her adventures in Wonderland. Her answer would be applauded by any Chaos Magician : “I know who I WAS
        when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The ancient statement considered so wise, “Know Thyself,” makes a
        powerful assumption that is so built into our very beings that we usually don’t even notice it. Specifically, it
        assumes that there is a “self ” to know.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">But what if who you are is infinitely malleable? Had you been brought
        up differently, every aspect of your being might be different. The way you think about things might be totally
        different. A person who is loving and tolerant might be hateful and racist. A person who is a fundamentalist
        Christian might be a Buddhist. This implies that who you are&mdash;your soul&mdash;is not a reality. Rather, it
        is something that we create as we develop and is capable of changing and becoming whatever we want. This
        attitude has some incredible benefits, but also leaves us with a question: if you can change to be whatever you
        want whenever you want, what is the “real you?”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The answer for Chaos Magicians goes back to A. O. Spare.
        Unfortunately, Spare was so much against doctrines that he really didn’t give a clear definition of the term:
        <span class="italic">Kia</span>. He describes it similar to the way Lao Tzu described the concept of the Tao:
        “The Tao which can be expressed in words is not the eternal Tao.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Carroll refers to the Kia as a unity that exerts will and perception.
        That was unclear to me (perhaps appropriately so), but luckily, Carroll also describes it as the Spirit or Life
        Force.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">That takes me back to my days as a member of AMORC, the Rosicrucian
        Brotherhood, which, at the time, was headquartered in San Jose, California. Many people equate the terms “soul”
        and “spirit.” I equated them until I studied with AMORC. They differentiate between the soul and the spirit. To
        them the spirit is another term for the life force and not the soul. Thus, each person would have both a Spirit
        and a Soul. With Chaos Magick, people have that animating Spirit, the Kia, which has some of the functions of
        the Soul, but is not the Soul. Spare wrote in <span class="italic">The Book of Pleasure</span> that the
        exuberance of the Kia gives us existence.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Since you can choose to be anything you want, it is likely that you
        will find a few paradigms that are your favorites. Thus, each Chaos Magician finds structures to work within,
        structures that may be completely different from those of any other practitioner. Everything is permitted. How
        do you know there isn’t a better paradigm, worldview, or methods of magickal practice for you? You don’t. So it
        is common for a Chaote to experiment and try different things.</span></div>

        Crowley discussed the concept of Aeons and how old-style magick (such as the magick of the Golden Dawn) belonged
        to the old aeon, which ended in 1904 and now, in the new aeon (of the Crowned and Conquering Childe), his system
        of Thelemic magick should be practiced. Chaos magicians would laugh at that (in fact many do a lot of laughing
        at dogmatic beliefs). It’s time to bring about the next cycle, the <span class="italic">Pandamonaeon</span>. And

        <span class="bold1">A Chaos Magick Banishing</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">When the first books on Chaos Magick were published, there was nothing
        in them about banishings. This was obvious to me. The people who created the concepts behind Chaos Magick were
        experienced magicians and would know enough to do some sort of banishing. Unfortunately, some of the people in
        the U.S. whom I saw hadn’t figured this out. Perhaps that was the cause of some of their unfortunate
        egocentrism. Or not. Eventually, however, banishing rituals were published.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I was first introduced to a version of this banishing by Ms. Lola
        Babalon. She was the first person to bring Chaos Magick to the U.S., and I was privileged to have her write a
        section in my <span class="italic">Modern Sex Magick</span>.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">The technique of this banishing is very simple, but requires a bit of explanation, as it
        uses what are commonly called the “European vowels.” These are the vowel sounds in alphabetical order, but
        pronounced a certain way:<div class="calibre2"><img alt="198" src="images/000111.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>
        <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">However, instead of using them in alphabetical order, try pronouncing
        them in this order: IEAOU. If you do, you will see that the sounds begin in the middle of the mouth, move to the
        back, and then to the front. In fact, it seems to be an extension of IAO. However, IEAOU is the key to this
        ritual.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This is my description of a ritual from Peter Carroll’s <span

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP THREE</span>. Repeat, but visualize the

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP FIVE</span>. Repeat, but visualize the

    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP SIX</span>. Repeat, but visualize the energy
        surrounding the genitals and intone “U.”</span></div>

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP SEVEN</span>. Repeat steps Two through Six
        in reverse order, going from the genitals to the head.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">That’s it. Does it sound like a mild variation to the LBRP to you? It
        sure does to me. In fact, if you’ve been practicing these lessons, you should have no trouble being wildly
        successful with this ritual.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Is this disappointing? Where’s the newness? Where’s the Chaos? I would
        contend that Chaos Magick isn’t new, it’s simply a new way of looking at magick. It’s a new paradigm with
        different names. Does it offer some new things? Experimentation? No. I’ve been urging you to try that from the
        beginning of these lessons. It’s a different approach. Like High Magick and Low Magick, it is no better or
        worse, it is just different. I would urge you to try it out and see how well it works for you.</span></div>

        <span class="bold1">A Practical Chaos Magick Ritual</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Part of this new paradigm is its directness. The following ritual was
        taught to me many years ago. I’ve found it effective and fun. Give it a try.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP ONE</span>. Develop a goal for the ritual.
        Go back to Lesson 7 and make a “sigil” on a piece of paper (no more than 3 x 3 inches) according to the system
        of Spare that represents your goal. Be sure that the final image gives no impression as to what the goal of the
        ritual is.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP THREE</span>. Hold the sigil in your left
        hand. Fully extend your left arm in front of you with your wrist bent inward so you can see the sigil in your
        hand. Focus intently&mdash;and I mean <span class="italic">intently</span>&mdash;on the sigil.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP FOUR</span>. While still focusing intently
        on the sigil, begin to turn to your left, spinning in place.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP FIVE</span>. Continue with your focus and
        your spinning in place. Speed up, going faster and faster. If you get dizzy, great. If you get nauseated, even
        better! Continue spinning and focusing until you are so dizzy or nauseated that you have to fall down.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP SIX</span>. Banish with laughter. Laugh loud
        and long.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">That’s it. Put away the sigil. Forget about it. Let the magick happen
        on its own.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As I wrote earlier, I’m sure some people will attack this section
        (Chaos Magick has some practitioners who support their understanding of the paradigm <span
          class="italic">very</span> strongly) as being incomplete or wrong. Or they will say I’m an old fogey and don’t
        get it. But how can you say that if nothing is true and everything is permitted? Chaos Magick is wonderful in
        its emphasis on experimentation, individuality, and the removal of unneeded excess. But in the end, it is simply
        a paradigm, a way to understand how magick works. It is every bit as accurate as the interpretation of the
        ancient shaman, the medieval sorcerer, the traditional ceremonial magician, or the contemporary Wiccan. It’s not
        better or worse than any of those approaches to magick, just different.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If you like it, use it. Perhaps, like me, rather than limiting
        yourself to only one type of magick, you can work efficiently within any magickal paradigm, including that of
        Chaos Magick. For example, you may find that Chaos Magick can be used as an addition to the system you most
        commonly use. To me, being able to work any magickal system is the way of the modern magician. Or not. After
        all, to a Chaote nothing is true and everything is permitted.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Let’s assume, however, that Chaos Magick is really the best <span
          class="italic">current</span> paradigm for understanding how magick works. Where will magick go tomorrow? How
        will we understand magick in the future? Perhaps the answer to these questions will be found in Postmodern
        Magick.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <h2 class="calibre29"><span class="calibre30">
        <span class="bold1">From the Enlightenment to Postmodernism</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">From the late 1940s through the early 1960s, the philosophical leaders
        of the new generation rebelled against the very character of the previous generation, adopting an ethos with new
        forms of art, music, philosophy, etc. One of the founders of this new movement, Jack Kerouac, described these
        people as the “Beat Generation,” and they became known as beatniks. Of course, following the concepts already
        described as the Hegelian dialectic, the movement didn’t radically change society, but it did alter it. In fact,
        some people saw that there was a lot of money to be made from the new generation and it was co-opted until many
        of its aspects became part of the mainstream.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This process seems to constantly repeat itself. In the early 1960s,
        the next generation took the rebellion against what went before to a new level. Instead of going on road trips
        as did Kerouac and his friends, the new leaders formed their own communities. The name eventually taken by this
        culture&mdash;based on the concept of them being hipsters&mdash;was hippies. Eventually, they too were co-opted
        by business, media, and their own naiveté and excesses.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Such rebellion against what went on previously can extend over longer
        periods. For example, at the end of the nineteenth century a movement began that was known as “modernism.”
        Modernism could be called “anti-Enlightenment.” There is a great deal of disagreement over when the
        Enlightenment began, but most people agree that it overthrew concepts such as the rights of aristocracies,
        control of society by religious structures, and the divine right of kings. The Enlightenment brought in reason
        and science as opposed to religious control, and selfgovernance rather than rule by royalty. Certainly the
        Declaration of Independence by the American colonies was influenced by Enlightenment thought. The document that
        founded the U.S.A., the Constitution begins not with an appeal to kings or gods, but by saying that this new
        country was created by “We the people.” How could anyone be against such principles of the Enlightenment?</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It’s true that the Enlightenment freed people from certain beliefs and
        dogmas, but it introduced many of its own. It still had certain religious beliefs, although by now it has
        shifted to Deism rather than religious orthodoxy. The Modernists rejected the concept of a loving God. They
        rejected old styles of music, art, architecture, and belief. Poet Ezra Pound (1885-1972) published a set of
        essays in 1935, with a title that exemplified Modernism, <span class="italic">Make It New.</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Postmodernism</span> developed after people
        became disillusioned with Modernism following WWII. It recognized that Modernism (indeed, any paradigm) has its
        own sets of beliefs, ideologies, and theories. Unfortunately, most people involved in a particular paradigm
        don’t recognize that what they have are a set of beliefs, etc. People assume that what they do is “normal” and
        everyone else is off base. As a comparison, I live in California and I notice that when people from other areas
        of the U.S. and the world speak English they have accents while we Californians don’t have one. I’m sure that
        people from London, England, or Atlanta, Georgia, think they don’t have accents but we Californians do.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">So rather than simply denounce anything old, like the Modernists, the
        Postmodernists tried to look beneath the ideologies and beliefs of previous generations and discover underlying
        truths. The result was the adoption of things and concepts that did work combined with the abandonment of old
        theories and assumptions as to <span class="italic">why</span> they worked.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The idea of Postmodern Magick follows this concept. It abandons all
        beliefs about why any form of magick works while acknowledging that it does work. So if you started out with
        this Postmodern concept, where would you look to understand how magick works from a twenty-first-century point
        of view?</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As I pointed out in the beginning of this lesson, Patrick Dunn, in his
        two books, uses a thoroughly modern understanding of language (linguistics) and how words work, and the
        understanding and use of symbols (semiotics). In a sense, then, Dunn’s concept of Postmodern Magick is both a
        direct outgrowth and an intensification of NLP and Chaos Magick.</span></div>
    <h2 class="calibre29"><span class="calibre30">
        <span class="bold1">Magick and Semiotics</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">The study of symbols has been incredibly important for magicians
        throughout history. The ancient shamans had systems using symbols in the form of drawings. Ancient Kabalists
        used, and modern Kabalists still use, symbols&mdash;such as the Hebrew alphabet or the Tree of Life&mdash;to
        represent various concepts. And Chaos magicians, of course, use sigils, often in the manner of A. O. Spare, to
        represent a focus for their magick. So for more than 10,000 years, the use of symbols in magick has been
        valuable.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The problem, of course, is getting across what the symbol means.
        Recently, a person asked me about the meaning of the symbol that looked like a skull. It might mean “poison.” It
        might mean “pirates.” It might represent the concept of mortality. It could even represent the concept of
        reincarnation.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Dunn gives the example of the word “tree.” If I were to say “Imagine a
        tree” to ten people it’s quite likely that they’d have ten different images, ranging from an oak or yew to a
        sort of universal tree that looks like a green ball at the end of a brown stick as drawn by young
        children.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If a word or symbol has different meanings for everyone, how can we
        say that it has any meaning at all? The solution to this for Postmodernists is easy yet clever. They simply say
        that <span class="italic">everything</span> is a symbol. Understanding this is a very powerful tool. If somebody
        cuts you off while driving, that may be a symbol to you that the other driver is rude and thoughtless. But to
        the person driving the other car, their action may be a symbol of needing to get someone to the hospital to save
        their life. By understanding this is all symbolic, we can accept that <span class="italic">someone else’s
          symbolism may not be ours</span>. This can result in a better understanding of that person. It also compares
        to the NLP concept that people are not their behaviors.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Since everything is symbolic, it follows that the way we communicate
        is also symbolic. Indeed, words are simply symbols for concepts we are trying to communicate. We put symbols
        together in certain ways. For example, the way I’ve put words together in these lessons forms a pattern known as
        the English language.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">We don’t only put symbols together. The mind also eliminates things it
        deems unnecessary. For example, use your peripheral vision and allow your sight to spread out to both the left
        and right. Even if you can only go a small amount beyond either side of these pages, you will see things that
        you didn’t notice just a moment before even though they were always there. Your vision is actually taking in
        those things outside these pages through your peripheral vision. Our unconscious minds eliminate those symbols
        deemed unnecessary to the immediate tasks at hand. Without this natural ability we’d go crazy from information
        overload, or TMI: “Too Much Information.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Dunn gives the example of finding a flat place to walk, then keeping
        your eyes straight ahead as you move forward. You’ll notice that your vision, especially at the edges, actually
        bobs and jerks up and down with your steps. When we’re not focusing on this, however, like some magickal form of
        image stabilization, our minds ignore the gyrations from our motions and eliminates them from our consciousness.
        We seem to be moving smoothly. In NLP this unconscious process is known as “deletion.” Dunn describes this
        ability to delete the bobbing in our vision as a “code.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">We have many such codes. According to Dunn, a code is “a set of assumptions about symbols
        that aid interpretation.” We each have codes that are associated with money. We have codes that are related to
        time (see the discussion earlier in this lesson on In Time and Through Time). We have codes about sex. So what
        does a set of codes and filters have to do with magick? According to the tenets of Postmodern Magick:<div

        <span class="bold1">The Practical Use of Semiotics for Magick from a Postmodern Perspective</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">You’re familiar with the use of sigils from earlier in this lesson and
        previous lessons. You’ve also understood their use (I hope!) from the worldview of the Kabalistic and Chaos
        Magick traditions. What about from the Postmodern tradition?</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">You begin, as with any form of practical magick, by understanding that
        you have a want or desire. But let’s look a bit deeper. Specifically, <span class="italic">why</span> do you
        have that want or desire? The answer would be that your interpretation of reality, as controlled by your codes,
        no longer meets your conscious needs. You have to get rid of the old codes and introduce new codes.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">Unfortunately, this takes more than one step. If you were simply to introduce new codes (by
        contemplating a sigil, for example), the result would be modified by the Hegelian Dialectic problem. That is, if
        you’re functioning under code A and want to get to a reality represented by code B, because you still have code
        A operating, you won’t get all the way to B, but only to C, somewhere between A and B:<div class="calibre2"><img
            alt="199" src="images/000150.jpg" class="calibre11" /></div>
        <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
        <div class="calibre12"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">The Hegelian Dialectic Problem
              (Thesis-Antithesis-Synthesis)</span></span></div>
        <div class="calibre5"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></span></div>
        <div class="calibre13">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">To get around this difficulty, also known as the
        Thesis-Antithesis-Synthesis problem, you can’t simply insert the new code. First, you have to obliterate the old
        code. This leaves you open to the insertion of something new, completely reprogramming you with the new code.
        This obliteration requires an altered state of consciousness that frees you from your old code.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It is not uncommon to experience such states. They can occur during
        intense trances, from the use of mind-altering substances, as a result of orgasm, etc. So why don’t we change
        our codes automatically? Because with nothing to trigger our minds in new ways when the altered state is over,
        our old codes simply fall back into place.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This is where the use of the sigil comes in. As Dunn writes in <span
          class="italic">Magic, Power, Language, Symbol</span>, “the sigil acts as a seed . . . The first thing we see
        when our conscious mind returns is the sigil, and we use that as the framework for rebuilding our codes.”</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Then, as we’ve described before, you just forget about the process and
        let the mind work. The new code goes into action, re-creating reality and bringing into your life the thing,
        behavior, or emotion that you want.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">By eliminating the old code and establishing a new one, you have
        literally created a new reality that replaces the previous unwanted reality.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Is it really this easy? Do you just need to change the code? Well, if
        you’re a Postmodern magician, the answer is, “Yes.” Of course, that also means it’s just as easy to change the
        code back to what it originally was, preventing the magick from occurring. In fact, it’s quite possible to say
        that the new code, even though it’s in place, may not be fully embedded in your unconscious. You could end up
        picking away at the new code you’ve put into place until there’s nothing left and the old familiar code finds
        its way back. This goes back to what has been described earlier in these lessons. The aim is to forget about the
        techniques and let the magick happen. If you worry about whether you did it right, will it work, etc., you take
        the focus away from the new code, allowing the old code to fall back into place. (Dunn calls worry “the great
        enemy of magic.”) Are their any solutions to this?</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Dunn mentions three ways to overcome this problem. First, you can work
        on establishing an attitude of indifference. This matches Spare’s frequently quoted comment, “Does not matter.
        Need not be.” It also matches the previously described idea of accepting that “what is, is.” Of course, the fact
        that I’m repeating this should imply that adopting this attitude and really believing it isn’t as easy as it may
        sound. I’ve known many people who talk about this attitude but who don’t “walk their talk.” Dunn suggests
        meditating on this concept and trying fasts to show that it doesn’t matter whether you get your daily dose of
        food or sex (or, I would add, of being online or text messaging).</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The second method is replacement. If you start thinking about anything
        to do with the new code or old code, change your thoughts to focus on something entirely different. For example,
        if your new code has you much better off financially than your old code, and you start thinking about problems
        making money, replace the thoughts with something else such as thinking about a new movie, reading a new book,
        going to a club, playing a game, etc.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The third method is to assume that the new code is firmly embedded and
        to act in accord with that assumption. Thus, if your new code is to become a musician, you think and act as a
        musician would think and act. Turn off the TV, move away from the computer, and start practicing your
        instrument.</span></div>
    <h2 class="calibre29"><span class="calibre30">
        <span class="bold1">Evoking the . . . Symbols?</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">In the previous section I gave an example of how to use a
        symbol&mdash;in this case, a sigil&mdash;to change our inner codes. This alters our reality, providing us with a
        new reality that incorporates our desired state. But what about something entirely different? For example,
        instead of trying to change our reality to a new state, what if we want to communicate with a non-physical
        entity, what is commonly called evocation? I described the traditional interpretation used by many thousands of
        people in an earlier lesson. How would a Postmodern magician make sense of it? The key is an understanding of
        what is meant by communication.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The usual idea of communication is that one person is giving
        information to another. If you think the world is flat and I tell you, “The world is round,” I’m giving you new
        information. You would then choose to ignore or incorporate that new information.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">However, this model of communication is making some assumptions.
        Specifically, it assumes that we both have the same understanding of three words: world, flat, and round. In
        this particular situation, you might think about what I said and come to the conclusion that I’m trying to
        communicate that the world is flat but the <span class="italic">edge</span> is round, making the Earth appear to
        be a disk. You could agree with me completely and we would both be happy even though we both had different
        conclusions. Even though I said, “The world is round,” what I actually meant&mdash;and assumed you
        understood&mdash;was that the Earth was spherical (and for this discussion let’s ignore the fact that the world
        is not a perfect, ball-like sphere).</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Another way of looking at communication, one that might more
        accurately reveal what is actually taking place, is that communication means throwing symbols to each other in
        order to make our symbolic systems correspond and match up. The more our symbolic systems match, the more we are
        communicating accurately. When they’re not close we’re not communicating well. When you consider how many
        symbols we all deal with it makes sense to assume that there will be difficulties and inexactness when
        attempting communication.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If we accept this postmodern interpretation of communication, the act
        of evocation involves trying as much as possible to match your symbolic system with that of the spirit you wish
        to evoke. You use incense the spirit “likes.” You say words the spirit understands. You look at the spirit’s
        signature or sigil. All of this is part of the spirit’s codes. What you’re doing is matching your codes to those
        of the spirit being evoked. The more your set of codes matches that of the entity, the better your communication
        with the spirit will be.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Earlier I wrote that the major danger of evocation is not possession,
        but obsession. The fact that you (and/or the magician’s seer) spend so much time making your (or his or her)
        codes match those of the entity being evoked makes this problem obvious to a Postmodern magician. That’s also
        why a magician will make symbolic anchors that link them to their own codes. These consist of word symbols
        (banishments and words of power), physical symbols (talismans, the Earth pentacle, magickal swords), etc.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">With these understandings, it’s possible to use concepts of Postmodern
        Magick to improve evocations. Since you want to make your codes as close to those of the spirit you’ll evoke,
        you can prepare for this by trying to match your codes to the spirit’s for several days prior to the formal
        evocation. Dunn, using the name of one of the spirits from the <span class="italic">Goetia</span>, Buer, refers
        to this process as “What would Buer do?” or WWBD.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">During the time before the actual evocation, no matter what you do,
        ask yourself, “WWBD?” Of course, change this for the name and qualities of any spirit you wish to evoke. So if
        you’re watching TV or reading a book or exercising or having lunch, ask yourself, “WWBD?” Would Buer be watching
        this show or TV at all? Is this a book Buer would read? Is this how Buer would exercise? Is this what Buer would
        eat? By following this process you make your codes closer to those of Buer (or whatever entity you’re evoking),
        and the actual communication with the spirit becomes easier and more accurate.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Practice</span>: The next time you are preparing
        to do an evocation, spend at least two days before the actual evocation practicing “WWBD?” for whatever entity
        you are going to evoke. This does not include the time spent searching for information about the entity so you
        can come to understand its codes, making it possible to match yours with its.</span></div>
    <h2 class="calibre29"><span class="calibre30">
        <span class="bold1">The Abstract Sigil</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Earlier in these lessons, I gave a method to create a sigil based on
        the concept of automatic drawing. In <span class="italic">Postmodern Magic</span>, Dunn gives another version of
        this process, which I consider excellent. It is especially good for bringing desired qualities into your
        life.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It is impossible to draw an image of “love” or “courage” or “wealth”
        or “calm.” Remember, however, that in this system everything, including words and ideas, are simply symbols that
        make up your codes. We’ve also learned that one of the most important tools in a magician’s armory is the
        knowledge of correspondences. Currently, the most popular books on correspondences remain Aleister Crowley’s
        <span class="italic">777</span> and <span class="italic">Sepher Sephiroth</span>. As I’ve pointed out, I
        question some of his correspondences. This means that when it concerns the correspondences I disagree with,
        Crowley’s codes and mine are not in harmony. There’s nothing wrong with that. I would hope that you will have
        differences with Crowley and with me. As individuals, we each have a unique set of codes, making our beliefs and
        our reality different from everyone else’s. Taking it one step further, this means we can create our own
        correspondences.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">So you could make your own correspondences for love, courage, or calm.
        For love, perhaps your symbol would be a couple staring into each other’s eyes. For courage you might choose the
        image of a soldier or perhaps a lion. For wealth you could choose a pile of money. For calm you might choose a
        quiet stream or a delicate rose. Perhaps you’ll choose other images.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">No matter what images you associate with these concepts, draw the
        image to the best of your ability. Next, draw it several times as fast as you can. As you move faster and
        faster, the image will become less and less like the original and most lifelike drawing. Eventually, the image
        won’t even look like the original. It will look like some sort of abstract piece of art.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Practice One</span>: For the next talisman you
        make, use this system to create an abstract sigil for your purpose. Charge the talisman following the techniques
        given previously.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Practice Two</span>: Create a sigil using this
        method. Charge it by following the Chaos Magick system given earlier in this lesson.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">All three of the systems described in this lesson present new ways of
        approaching material that has been described previously&mdash;including earlier in these lessons&mdash;using
        other paradigms. Some of you reading this may be wondering, “Why bother?” After all, what I described in
        previous lessons has worked for hundreds and thousands of years. As the saying goes, “If it ain’t broke, don’t
        fix it.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Well, yes. What I presented in the previous lessons in this book is a
        modern explanation of the practices of magick as they are used today by tens of thousands of people. And in most
        cases, when people are doing something that isn’t a simple variation on what I’ve presented, you should be able
        to understand what you’re seeing or hearing.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">However, each generation develops its own “voice.” Over the past fifty
        or more years, terms meaning “good” have included: gear, fab, cool, kewl, hot, bad, phat, awesome, alvo,
        excellent, the bee’s knees, bitchin’, the bomb, bumping, businawreck, butter, capitol, cherry, choice, dope, far
        out, fierce, fly, fresh, gnarly, hip, horrorshow, ill, kickass, killer, off the hook, peachy, primo, rad, sick,
        slammin’, spiffy, stellar, sweet, tight, wicked, and many more. Besides being different voices, they are also
        symbolic of the paradigm by which a person lives. Someone saying, “That’s capitol, old fellow,” will have a
        different worldview than someone who says, “Dude, that’s slammin’!” Similarly, this lesson has given you three
        of what I consider to be the most important paradigms for the future of magick. NLP comes from a different
        field. Chaos Magick is currently popular among many magicians. Postmodern Magick could be the future paradigm
        we’ll all be using twenty years from now when we discuss magick. Or, perhaps there will be something else that
        develops.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">What I want to make clear is that the purpose of this lesson has been
        to give you a taste of these three paradigms. There is no way I could thoroughly explain every aspect of each
        one. Already, there have been hundreds of books published on NLP, and a couple of dozen that either are directly
        related to Chaos Magick or refer to it. As of this writing there are only two books on Postmodern Magick as
        described by Patrick Dunn.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If you are fascinated by any of these systems, I encourage you to get
        some of the books listed in the bibliography of this lesson. That would be a good start.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I must repeat, though, that NLP was not designed to be taught through
        books, DVDs, or mail-order courses. It was designed to be taught in trainings and in person. A good trainer will
        be speaking to your conscious and unconscious minds, giving you far more than you could ever get from reading a
        book or watching a video. Reading books on NLP is a great way to learn about it, but to learn the techniques I
        would suggest getting trained.</span></div>
    <h2 class="calibre29"><span class="calibre30">
        <span class="bold1">Conclusion</span>
      </span></h2>
    <div class="calibre8">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Earlier editions of <span class="italic">Modern Magick</span> didn’t
        conclude so much as they just stopped. I always had the feeling that it felt as if I had sort of run out of
        things to say, so rather than blather on I just shut up.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">To be honest, I didn’t like the way those earlier editions ended. As a
        result, I have, quite literally, spent years looking for a good conclusion, a way to end these lessons that
        would let someone close these pages and go, “Ahh. That’s it!” I wanted readers and students to have a very
        satisfied feeling. A currently popular expression would be that I wanted people to have a “sense of
        closure.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I was wrong.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I’ve come to realize that if these lessons leave you with a satisfied
        “Now I know it” feeling, these lessons have failed.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I’ve come to realize that <span class="italic">there is no conclusion
          to the study of magick</span>. There never can be such a conclusion. I want people who read and study these
        lessons to feel unsatisfied and hungry for more. I want people to realize that magick is a practice and a study,
        and to move forward it’s important to put down the pages of any lessons or book and actually do the work.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">There is no conclusion to the practice of
          magick.</span> As long as people live and breathe and hope for something better in their lives, there will be
        new approaches to magick and new things to discover. I hope some of you reading this will be the ones who make
        those discoveries. I hope you share them with others as I have shared my ideas with you.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">There is no conclusion to the evolution of
          magick</span> as long as children wonder why the sky is blue and as long as people want to find out what is on
        the other side of the mountain, or the ocean, or the galaxy, or the universe. To paraphrase the words of the
        late Robert Kennedy (certainly in a way he never expected), some people see things as they are and say why. I
        dream things that never were and say why not.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I hope you will dream with me. Magick isn’t something you do. Magick
        is something you are. Magick isn’t a goal, it’s a path. It’s a path to the other side of . . .</span></div>

          <span class="bold1">A Ritual to Vastly Increase Personal Magickal Power</span>
        </span></span></h1>
    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">The following is a ritual that you may wish to attempt. I introduced
        this ritual in the first edition of <span class="italic">Modern Magick</span>. Although I didn’t realize it back
        then, having never heard of NLP, it actually follows many NLP principles and concepts based on the timeline. In
        Lesson 12 I gave a ritual using the timeline that can help you create your desired future. Here, without using a
        formal timeline but using the concepts behind timeline work, you literally re-create your past to enhance your
        present, changing what you are rather than what you will become. The end result of working this ritual will be
        an increase of your magickal abilities and talents many times over. If you think about this ritual, you don’t
        have to limit it to magickal power.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP ONE</span>. Make a sigil representing
        magickal power.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP TWO</span>. Perform the Opening by
        Watchtower.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP THREE</span>. Sit down and work on
        visualizing a calendar in front of you. See the pages turn so that you go back in time, back into your
        past.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP FOUR</span>. When you go back a minimum of
        ten years or half your age, see the pages stop turning. Now visualize yourself, as you looked at that date. Take
        time to make the visualization as complete as possible. Allow your consciousness to merge with your younger
        self.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP FIVE</span>. Now concentrate on the image of
        the sigil that you created. When it is as strong as it possibly can be, visualize it going onto the forehead of
        you as your younger self. See it virtually tattooed on your forehead.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP SIX</span>. Once it is firmly tattooed on
        your forehead, immediately cease the visualization and return to the image of the calendar. Now see the pages
        moving the other way so that you move forward to the present day.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">STEP SEVEN</span>. End with the Closing by
        Watchtower.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This ritual will have the effect of causing a sudden and notable
        increase in your magickal abilities. By altering the design of the sigil you may affect exactly how this ritual
        increases your magickal abilities. Although this ritual will not change your level of magickal knowledge, it
        will make you more receptive to magickal information. It may increase your ability to memorize and your
        understanding of that material.</span></div>

        resulting in the many letters and emails I just mentioned. The letters consisted of questions about <span
          class="italic">Modern Magick</span> and magick subjects in general. I was surprised to discover that many of
        these questions asked amazingly similar things. In fact, many of them were so similar that they used the same

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There is an “area” of the Internet, which used to be popular, called
        the Usenet. This is the part of the Internet known for having newsgroups. The Usenet is like a huge bulletin
        board. Each newsgroup is a section of that bulletin board dedicated to a particular subject. Within each
        newsgroup you can read messages posted by anyone or post your own comments. Since the time this appendix was
        first published for the second edition of <span class="italic">Modern Magick</span>, the Usenet has largely been
        superseded by forums, personal websites, and text messaging.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">When people first investigate a newsgroup they are urged to watch and
        read only&mdash;known as <span class="italic">lurking</span>&mdash;until they are familiar with the subjects.
        (This is still a common request when people join forums, but regrettably, it is often ignored.) Sometimes, in
        order to help these people better understand a particular newsgroup or subject, the archives of the newsgroup
        will have a FAQ, a document that answers “Frequently Asked Questions.” Again, this has carried over to modern
        Internet forums.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This appendix, then, is what I call “The <span class="italic">Modern

          <span class="bold1">On the Magickal Elements and Associated Directions</span>
        </span></span></h1>
    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Question:</span> In the LBRP,
          the elements associated with the directions (starting at the east and going clockwise) are Air, Fire, Water,
          and Earth. In the BRH, however, they are Fire, Earth, Air, and Water. Is this a mistake, a trap for the
          unwary, or is there some reason for the change?</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre14">
      <div class="calibre19"><span class="bold">Answer:</span> The LBRP deals with the physical plane and the lower
        astral. The BRH deals with the upper astral plane, which relates more to astrological or planetary influences.
        Thus, when a magician performs the LBRP, he or she associates and links the magickal elements with the
        traditional physical associations. When the magician performs the BRH, however, these associations must change.
        For it is here that the magician should associate the directions linked to the magickal elements with the order
        of the astrological elemental attributions. The following charts may clarify this for you:<div class="calibre2">

        </span></span></h1>
    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Question:</span> In the LBRP
          the archangels are Ra-Fay-El, Gahb-Ray-El, Mih-Chai-El, and Ohr-Ree-El. But the correspondences on the Tree of
          Life don’t include Ohr-Ree-El. Why not?</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">Answer:</span> The Tree of Life is a wonderful map
        for understanding everything in the universe. But we should never equate the map with reality.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Although the Tree of Life is a map of the workings of the universe, it
        does not include everything. There are many archangels. Some are included on the Tree of Life while others are
        not. Many archangels are not associated with the Sephiroht. Ohr-Ree-El is one of those.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">According to Davidson in his excellent book <span class="italic">A
          Dictionary of Angels</span>, Ohr-Ree-El (also spelled “Oriel,” “Auriel,” and “Uriel,” and meaning “the Light
        of God” or “the Fire of God”) is also an “Angel of Destruction,” and helped the magicians in the courts of the
        Egyptian Pharaoh. Other sources quoted by Davidson make Ohr-Ree-El either equal to the Roman Hades or the
        archangel of salvation. Ohr-Re-El is the angel who held the fiery sword which kept Adam and Eve from returning
        to Eden. It was also Ohr-Ree-El who wrestled with Jacob and was sent by God to warn Noah of the flood that was
        to come.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In some ways Ohr-Ree-El is also like Thoth, who brought wisdom,
        language, and magick to the Egyptians. Ohr-Ree-El is said to have spoken to Ezra (a Jewish patriarch) and given
        him the secrets of the mysteries of heaven. Ohr-Ree-El also brought the secrets of alchemy and the Kabalah to
        earth.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Ohr-Ree-El has (or had) all of these tasks and responsibilities (as
        well as being the archangel associated with the element of Earth and the direction north), yet there is not a
        place for this archangel on the Tree of Life. This is because a map only shows what it needs to show. A map of
        Denver, Colorado, does not also show the streets of Geneva, Switzerland! Likewise, the map of the workings of
        the universe known as the Tree of Life only shows its view of the universe, a view in which Ohr-Ree-El is not a
        major player. That does not mean that Ohr-Re-El is unimportant. It only means that Ohr-Re-El does not play a
        part on the Tree of Life.</span></div>

          <span class="bold1">On Determining if a Ritual Worked</span>
        </span></span></h1>
    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Question:</span> I don’t feel
          anything when I do rituals. Does that mean that they are not working?</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">Answer:</span> You cannot determine if your magick
        has worked by anything you may feel or experience during a ritual. The success of any magickal ritual is only
        determined by your result. Some people feel (or think they feel) a great deal in a magickal ritual. Others may
        feel nothing. Either person may have success with magick.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Failure may occur if you feel nothing out of the ordinary but believe
        you are supposed to feel something. If you don’t feel something that indicates to you that your ritual was a
        success, you may become sure that your magick didn’t work. This assumption of failure, mixed with a continued
        belief that your ritual failed, will virtually assure that your magick, in fact, will fail.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Magick does not take place only during a ritual. It occurs all the
        time. By believing that your ritual failed, you, quite literally, are working magick to cause that failure. If
        your ritual took ten minutes to perform, and then you spend the next two weeks thinking it has failed&mdash;in a
        sense doing magick to see that it will fail&mdash;you will overpower your ritual with the magick that followed.
        That is one reason why, when you finish a ritual, you should forget about it. That way you cannot accidentally
        work against yourself. If you do happen to think about the ritual and the magick, you would be well advised to
        develop the attitude that you know the magick will be successful.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This is not to say that you will never experience signs or indications
        of some magickal effect during a ritual. In my personal experience I have found that there are two indicators
        that something magickal has taken place. The first is “∆ C” or the Delta C factor, also known as time
        displacement. Specifically, you may think that the ritual has taken several hours when it only took twenty
        minutes. Conversely, you may think that the ritual only lasted thirty minutes when, in fact, it lasted several
        hours.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Another sign that some magickal effect has taken place during your
        ritual is “∆ T” or the Delta T factor: a change in the perceived temperature. If this effect occurs, the
        temperature of the area will seem to become either quite warm or cold.</span></div>

          What should I do?</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">Answer:</span> I do not advise you to go against
        your parents’ wishes. You may think that they are unfair, but their life experience means that they have had
        experiences you have not had. It is likely they are trying to protect you from what they see as harm. If your
        parents were magicians, they might be helping you to learn magick safely.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I regret to tell you that you may simply have to wait until you’re
        older before becoming more active with magick. Most magickal groups won’t accept people under eighteen unless

                you. As you get older it could prevent you from getting desired jobs. By being able to determine what
                you can tell somebody of your interests, you can, as it were, “hide in plain sight.” Everyone can see
                you but they won’t know your real interests unless they are open to them in a positive way. Finally, by
                being sociable you are able to meet people and hear what they have to say. It’s possible that some of

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There are multiple levels of keeping on schedule. The first is
        physical. So, for example, make up your mind to do a particular physical action. You might choose to always open
        a door with your left hand. If you err by using your right hand to open a door, simply make a mark in a small
        notebook that you carry for that purpose. Or, you could keep a rubber band around your wrist and snap it so that
        it slaps you for going against what you wanted to do.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The next level is verbal. Make up your mind that you will not use a
        specific word. For example, you might decide that you will not use the word “I” for a week. Make marks or snap
        the rubber band when you go against your will.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The most difficult level is thought. Make up your mind that you will
        not think of something specific for a week. For example, you might decide to not think of watching television
        for a week. Use the rubber band snap or book marking when you think about watching TV.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">You will notice that the first day of each level will be filled with
        snaps or marks in your book. But as you go through the week your control will become greater and the marks or
        snaps will decrease. This is tangible evidence that your control of your will is increasing.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">Answer:</span> The Air dagger can be replaced by
        anything that represents Air to you. This could include a fan, a feather, or something else. As a standard tool,
        such as the dagger used for the LBRP, you can use your index finger or both the index and middle finger. Extend
        one or both of those fingers, as if pointing, from the other fingers that are curled back toward the palm. Any
        cup can function as the magickal chalice. You could even use the twist-off top from a bottle of soda. Earth
        could be a small stone and fire could be a match, matchbook, lighter, or a red object.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Don’t let the inaccessibility of magickal tools prevent you from doing
        rituals. Don’t wait until you have that perfect Air dagger to do a ritual. Use a butter knife or a fan. I have a
        delightful fan made of sandalwood for this purpose (I bought it at Disneyland!). If you don’t have a water
        chalice made of glass, get one of pewter. Or stainless steel. Or silver plate. Or wood. Or use a large seashell.
        Or use a paper or Styrofoam cup.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">Answer:</span> Which one? There are many books that
        claim to be THE <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span>. I have several books with that name and several
        articles that are supposed to be excerpts from the “real” thing. They all have just one thing in common: they
        are nothing but inventions of contemporary authors.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The most popular version is loosely based on Sumerian
        religion&mdash;very loosely. In fact, much of it appears to be taken from <span class="italic">The Beginnings of
          History and Chaldean Magic</span> by François Lenormant.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This version is also based on some of the writings of Aleister Crowley
        and the works of horror writer H. P. Lovecraft and others who wrote in what is known as the Cthulhu Mythos,
        stories which used the fictional entities created by Lovecraft (and later, others).</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Lovecraft invented the entire idea of an evil book called the <span
          class="italic">Necronomicon</span>. In January of 1934, Lovecraft wrote a letter where he says that the <span
          class="italic">Necronomicon</span> is nothing but a figment of his imagination. And in August of 1934,
        Lovecraft wrote that not only was the <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> his own invention, but so, too,
        were the entities from the Cthulhu Mythos including Azathoth, Yog-Sothoth, Nyarlathotep, Shub-Niggurath, and
        others.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">But even though the different versions of the <span
          class="italic">Necronomicon</span> that have been published are all fakes, does that mean that they are also
        ineffective? Not necessarily. The Cthulhu Mythos, as part of the current magickal world, has caught the
        imagination of a surprisingly large number of people. I believe that their mental beliefs and repeated rituals
        have created <span class="italic">thought forms</span> that function, to an extent, along the lines of the
        entities described in the various versions of the <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span>.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I would point out, however, that the entities of traditional Western
        magick have been invoked and evoked for many hundreds, even thousands, of years. My experience indicates that in
        practice they are much stronger than the <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> entities.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">So can the entities of the <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> be
        used in magick? Absolutely. Just as any mental creation can be used in magick. But why would you want to use
        them? If you follow the writings of Lovecraft and other fiction writers, the entities of the <span
          class="italic">Necronomicon</span> are evil, intent on enslaving humanity and controlling the world.
        Frequently (in the stories, at least), the entities of the Cthulhu Mythos are uncontrollable and destroy (or
        attempt to destroy) those people who call them. Are you willing to chance that? Are you prepared to chance
        that?</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">Note:</span> I had read all of Lovecraft’s short
        stories and novellas before I even started to work on the first form of <span class="italic">Modern
          Magick</span>. After years of personal study and practice, <span class="italic">Modern Magick</span> began as
        a series of lessons I taught in southern California. After that I wrote it out as a series of fifty-two short
        lessons as I wanted to teach it via mail order. They were never published or printed and I no longer have copies
        of them. A publisher of mail order courses contacted me through my friend, Scott Cunningham, and asked to see
        them. After reading them, he asked me to rewrite them in longer lessons for him to publish. I did so, but within
        six months the company folded. I still have copies of those lessons that were published. I rewrote them into the
        format that would appear several years later as the first edition of <span class="italic">Modern Magick</span>.
        I’m describing this to point out that I was very familiar with the original concept of the <span
          class="italic">Necronomicon</span> years before any published version of <span class="italic">Modern
          Magick</span> appeared. Further, <span class="italic">Modern Magick</span> was created <span
          class="italic">before</span> the most popular version of the <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> was
        published.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Long after versions of <span class="italic">Modern Magick</span> were
        complete, I began to receive letters asking me about the <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span>. The number of
        letters gradually increased, so much so that I set up the above message to be a standard response to the letters
        I received.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In 1999, I was invited to the Starwood festival in upstate New York to
        give some workshops. While there, I attended a workshop titled “Magick and the <span
          class="italic">Necronomicon</span>,” given by John Gonce and Daniel Harms. It was a wonderful and humorous
        workshop.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">About a year later I was invited by Llewellyn to add a section to
        <span class="italic">Modern Magick</span>. That added section was this FAQ. It first appeared in 2001 and
        included the previous response concerning the <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span>.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Harms and Gonce have written a wonderful book titled <span
          class="italic">The Necronomicon Files</span>, and I would encourage anyone interested in the <span
          class="italic">Necronomicon</span> to read it. In the book they point out, correctly, that I did not publish
        this FAQ, with the above copy of letters I sent out, until after I attended their workshop. They suggested that
        I didn’t think the <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> was a “problem” worth comment upon until “somebody”
        talked about how people were taking it seriously. I’m going to assume that by “somebody” they meant
        themselves.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">While the dates are correct and my attendance at their workshop is
        absolutely true (I had a great time), I had been writing the above message to individuals long before I attended
        their workshop and did not need “somebody” to tell me that some people were taking the <span
          class="italic">Necronomicon</span> seriously. It wasn’t mentioned in the first edition of <span
          class="italic">Modern Magick</span> because it didn’t exist when I was writing it. My comments about the <span
          class="italic">Necronomicon</span> written above were originally written long before I attended their
        workshop. I added the comments in the FAQ to <span class="italic">Modern Magick</span> because I was asked to
        write some more material by Llewellyn.</span></div>

        </span></span></h1>
    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Question 1:</span> Will you
          send me the name of a group in my area I can join?</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Question 2:</span> What do you
          think of the group known as XXXXXX?</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">Answer:</span> I’m sorry, but as a rule I don’t
        recommend groups. Why? Well, when I meet people involved in a group they may be excellent and doing good work,
        but in the following months or years they might change and not be as good as they once were.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If I had recommended a group to you several months or years ago but
        you waited until recently to join, you might have fallen into a bad situation. If they changed between the time
        I knew them and the time you became involved with them, the same might be true. The direct cause of your
        involvement with a negative situation would have been my remarks. I do not want this to happen. Therefore, I
        don’t recommend any groups. So what can you do?</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">My suggestion is to go to local metaphysical bookstores and occult
        shops and ask questions. Perhaps you’ll meet somebody who is part of a good group. You could also do some
        searches on the Internet.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I would also add that when considering joining a group you should
        listen to your heart. Does it feel okay or does the group or its leaders (or some of its members) make you feel
        uncomfortable? Do you feel that something is wrong? Do you feel like they are trying to use psychology to
        “encourage” you to join or stay a member? Are they charging what you consider to be large amounts of money? Do
        they tell you how special and powerful you are (or can be) but that you need them to help you manifest this
        power? Do they offer “astral” or “proxy” initiations? For Western groups all of this is very questionable, and
        you might wish to stay away.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There is another alternative I’d like to suggest. Why not get a group
        of friends with similar interests together to form a study and practice group? Several groups have written to me
        and told me that they are using <span class="italic">Modern Magick</span> as their training text. There is no
        reason that you cannot do that, too. Once you’ve worked your way through <span class="italic">Modern
          Magick</span> you can then move on and explore other systems and techniques. Good book titles are given in the
        bibliography found later in these lessons.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The question of my opinion of various groups is a bit more difficult.
        You see, I could say that a group didn’t have much value while another person might find the information the
        group presented to be of inestimable value. One student may find my analysis of a group accurate while another
        may find it completely wrong. In fact, somebody may find that a group is exactly what they need at this time for
        their spiritual and magickal development. If I discourage a person from joining that group, I may be slowing
        that person’s spiritual evolution.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">So rather than commenting on the value of a particular group, I would,
        instead, urge you to investigate in every way you can. Talk to a wide variety of people. Find out if there are
        any former members who will talk with you. Talk to current members.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Then, if you decide to join, I urge you to take what I call “baby
        steps.” Go into a group slowly, not participating fully with that group for months or longer. As long as you are
        ready to exit a group if they turn out to be inappropriate for you at this time, you should not have any
        trouble. And as I said above, listen to your heart.</span></div>

          <span class="bold1">On Ceremonial Magick and the Kabalah Being Patriarchal</span>
        </span></span></h1>
    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Question:</span> I’m a Wiccan.
          Aren’t ceremonial magick traditions and the Kabalah patriarchal?</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">Answer:</span> Although some groups and
        individuals, both ancient and modern, are patriarchal, that is more a sign of the times and the individuals
        involved than of the tradition itself. The Kabalah, for example, sees deity both as androgynous and in the forms
        of male and female, similar to the relationship of Shiva and Shakti in Tantric traditions. Further, any name (or
        more appropriately, title) of deity, archangels, or angels ending in “-ah,” “-aht,” “-ath,” “-oth,” “-os,” or
        “-oht” is feminine. El-oh-heem, one of the most-used names of deity, is female singular (El-oh-ah, meaning
        “goddess”) with a male plural suffix (-eem). Thus it refers to deity as neither patriarchal nor matriarchal in
        nature but as having qualities of both male and female.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">While there are some very patriarchal organizations, such is rarely
        the case with magickal groups. Several important ceremonial magick groups have, in fact, been led by women. The
        first initiate of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn was a woman, Moina Mathers. For many years women led the
        Golden Dawn. After Paul Foster Case, founder of the Builders of the Adytum (BOTA) died, a woman became the head
        of the order. Women today lead groups that claim to be the Golden Dawn. Various OTO groups are run by women. At
        least one current of the AA, Crowley’s replacement for the Golden Dawn, was passed through a woman.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Most spiritual traditions are neither patriarchal nor matriarchal.
        They become so as a result of the people who are involved in the organization. I would suggest, therefore, that
        if you are interested in a non-patriarchal, ceremonial magick group, all you need do is keep looking. They’re
        out there.</span></div>

          <span class="bold1">On Chaos Magick</span>
        </span></span></h1>
    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic">NOTE:</span> This part of the <span
          class="italic">Modern Magick</span> FAQ has been superseded by the section on Chaos Magick in Lesson 12. I
        decided to leave this in for historical reference and to show what I was thinking on the subject almost a decade
        prior to the third edition of these lessons.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Question:</span> What is Chaos
          Magick?</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">Answer:</span> While many would say that Chaos
        Magick is entirely new, as far as I have been able to tell it is simply a new way of looking at something old;
        it is a new paradigm.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">For example, most magicians today believe that magickal power (other
        than any that is inherent in objects such as plants, holy stones, etc.) comes from within oneself and/or from
        the Divine, the source of everything. Chaos magicians say that chaos is the source of everything. As a magician,
        you attempt to tap into this source of power. For Chaos magicians, instead of believing all such magick power
        comes from the Divine, they tap into “chaos.” In both instances the results can be the same. Even the concept is
        the same. The major difference is the name and the approach.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Perhaps the one really new idea in Chaos Magick is the desire to break
        through many centuries of accretions that surround magickal traditions and see what is the minimum necessary to
        do magick. Their attitude is that it makes sense to do the minimum necessary to achieve the maximum
        results.</span></div>

          <span class="bold1">On Joining Several Magickal Groups and Covens</span>
        </span></span></h1>
    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Question:</span> I’ve just
          discovered magick and I’d like to join a bunch of groups and a coven or two. However, some of my teachers have
          said I should only study one magickal system. Is this correct?</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">Answer:</span> This does not have a simple, single
        answer. In some instances, such rules are used by a group (or a leader of a group) to have power and control
        over members. However, there are some good reasons why it might be better for a person, especially one who is
        just starting out in the study of magick, to only participate with one group.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">First, let’s look at why being a member of only one group might be the
        best for the group. When a magickal group works together, after a time they develop a group spirit known as an
        “egregore.” If you mix one group’s philosophy, training, techniques, and beliefs with those of another group, it
        blurs the egregore and weakens it. This can end up wrecking the unity and cohesion of the group.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There are also problems students can have if they are studying
        different magickal systems or with several groups simultaneously. Sometimes a person is not capable of keeping a
        multiplicity of systems separate in his or her mind and actions. Rather than learning from each system, he/she
        becomes confused and does not advance as quickly as she/he should in any of those systems. Also, there is an
        idea among some students, especially beginners, that all magick is the same but the rituals have variations.
        This is simply not true. Although there are similarities between systems, there are also stark or subtle
        contrasts. The desire to blend systems without a thorough knowledge of them can have negative results on the
        student and the groups.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I suggest that in most instances it is most effective for a student to
        learn one system very thoroughly first. Then he/she can study with other groups and learn other systems. Even
        after the student has done this it is important that he/she be able to keep different systems separate when
        working with various groups.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Once an intermediate student has determined that he or she can keep
        different systems separate and grow in both (or more) systems, I see no reason why such a person should not work
        with more than one group. This is assuming that such a student is also able to divide his or her attention among
        the groups and still advance within those organizations.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As an alternative, if a student feels confined by the limitations of
        any one (or even several orders), he/she might wish to develop his/her own system. In my opinion, the thing to
        keep in mind is that magickal orders should challenge members to grow spiritually and magickally. That means
        study and practice with things that may not be of immediate interest to you but are of immense value in your
        development. When given the opportunity to work with multiple systems, some students will focus on what they
        like and ignore other aspects. This slows their spiritual and magickal progress.</span></div>

          <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">. . . the more they really do stay the same. More than fifteen
              years after I first received a question about joining multiple groups and studying many topics, I saw this
              on an Internet forum:</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">“I have recently been considering the Kabalah as part of my
              studies, especially the Tree of Life. I just picked up a copy of <span class="italic">The Mystical
                Qabalah</span> by Dion Fortune. It’s my study of magick that has brought me here. I am not one for
              completely following tradition or staying at one point of study for too long . . . The only problem with
              this is that I spread myself way too thin, I don’t dig deep enough. This is probably because everything
              that has to do with the occult fascinates me. I like things that are hidden away, that are secret. I have
              even given thought to enrolling in an online school of magick.”</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I responded this way: “A lot of people express your feelings. I
              know because at one time I was there, too. I wanted to know everything, I wanted to know it NOW, and I
              wanted to be able to use it all, this afternoon.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">“Unfortunately, it didn’t work that way. What I ended up with
              was a superficial understanding of a variety of topics and areas. I always felt like something was missing
              and I needed to learn more, MORE! There’s nothing wrong with that, of course. One of my personal beliefs
              is that you don’t die when you stop breathing, you die when you stop learning. But all I was learning
              wasn’t getting me anywhere. I had to take a step back and discover why.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">“I decided that I needed to study one system in depth and I’m
              glad I did. What I found was I needed a grounding, a firm base, a place to start and to which I could
              compare other concepts.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">“I thought that this might box me in&mdash;and I was willing to
              accept that (grrrrr) for a while. Surprisingly, just the opposite occurred. My in-depth study of one
              system left plenty of room for looking at other systems because my time was spent more effectively.
              Instead of being locked in I found that I was going beyond mere learning all the way to understanding on a
              very intuitive level. I was able to comprehend, as I studied new things, X is based on Y, Z is a latter
              addition, M is irrelevant, Y is just wrong, P is a great idea so I’ll incorporate it, etc.</span></div>
          <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">“Instead of locking me into one system, an in-depth study of one
              area resulted in opening me up to the potential in all areas. Therefore, I would respectfully suggest that
              you consider taking a breath and choose to study just one system for a period of time. Wicca claims a year
              and a day is a good length of time, and I would agree. However you might want to choose to try this out
              for just six months . . . or even just three months, and see how it goes.”</span></div>

    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Question:</span> When doing an
          evocation, how do the various spirits communicate with you?</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">Answer:</span> The spirits communicate in a variety
        of ways. In the work I have done this has included everything from hearing a voice in English (from quiet
        whispers to loud singing), to hearing an internal voice (some sort of telepathy), to just a feeling or “knowing”
        what the message from the intelligence is.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This brings up another point that is frequently asked. Are the spirits
        objectively real? Are they separate entities having lives of their own or are they simply aspects of our inner
        selves? Many magicians today, inculcated with various psychological theories of the mind (especially those of
        Jung), believe the latter view. As I have stated before, I refer to this as the “psychologization of magick.”
        Personally, I believe, and my experience has shown, that the former is a better representation of reality. It
        certainly functions as if the spirits are real.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Notice that in both versions I have said that the people supporting
        the differing views <span class="italic">believe</span> a certain way; it is subjective. We may never know which
        is the objective reality. Frankly, to me it doesn’t matter. What matters is the result of the magickal

          reason I’ve stopped doing regular rituals. It’s not that I don’t want to; it’s just that I never seem to have
          the time, interest, or desire. Why is this happening and what can I do about it?</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">Answer:</span> I have received this question many
        dozens, if not hundreds of times. I want you to know that not only are you not alone, you are actually
        experiencing something that is very common.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Newton’s first law of motion states that a body at rest tends to
        remain at rest. This property is known as inertia.</span></div>

        happens on the non-physical.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">When you do rituals, you are beginning to change your life and put
        your higher self in charge of your being while overcoming the common, everyday ruler of your body, what I call
        the magickal ego. But since you are used to being controlled by this aspect of your being, your body, mind, and
        spirit try to keep it in control. They resist change. They create reasons not to change. It is they who prevent
        you from doing ritual.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Newton’s first law also states that a body in motion tends to continue
        in motion. That means if you simply use willpower to force yourself back into doing rituals, and keep at it,
        those feelings of not wanting to do rituals will fade and doing ritual will become a pleasurable joy. It will
        become uncomfortable <span class="italic">not</span> to do regular rituals.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">So if you are feeling resistance to doing rituals, know that you’re
        doing things right! Now get yourself up and force yourself to do it. Put down these lessons and do it right now.
        Then set a time to repeat the rituals tomorrow. Within a few weeks of regular repetition you will notice a
        change and practice will become a habit.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Question:</span> I have to
          work at odd hours and my sleeping schedule is even more erratic. In your book you talk about regular
          performance of the Four Adorations at specific times. How can I do that when I might be either at work or
          asleep?</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">Answer:</span> Many years ago there was the idea
        that magicians might have to wait until a certain date in a future year in order to perform a specific ritual.
        While that may be the optimal time for doing a specific ritual, it does not mean that it is the only
        time.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If you are doing a ritual that is solar in nature, let’s say for
        finding missing property, the optimal time to perform it would be during a summer month, during the waxing of
        the Moon or, even better, on the full Moon, on a Sunday during the hour of the Sun.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If you can’t wait until the summer, the next best time to do the
        ritual would be during the waxing of the Moon or full Moon on a Sunday during the hour of the Sun.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If you can’t wait until the full Moon, then the best time to do it
        would be during the waxing of the Moon on a Sunday during the hour of the Sun.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If you can’t wait until the waxing of the Moon, then the best time to
        do it would be on a Sunday during the hour of the Sun.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If waiting until Sunday would be too late, then the next best time
        would be today, during the hour of the Sun.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">And, if for some reason you cannot perform the ritual during the hour
        of the Sun, the time to do the ritual is now.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Concerning the adorations, however, there are timing functions which
        do need to be observed. After all, greeting Ra at sunset instead of sunrise would not only be insulting to Ra
        but would also put you out of synchronization with forces of nature around you.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">So, in my opinion, the key is to do each of the adorations as close as
        possible to their appropriate times. Example: Assume that you must go to sleep at 10:30 P.M. and rise at 6:30
        A.M. You are going to sleep before the optimal time to do the midnight adoration and rising before or after the
        optimal time of doing the sunrise adoration, depending upon the time of the year. Do the midnight evocation
        before going to sleep. Do the sunrise adoration immediately upon rising or, if the Sun rises after you wake up,
        at the appropriate time.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If you don’t think you have the privacy you would like to do the
        adorations, re-read the information on the Great Voice. If you are working at noon or sunset, take a break and
        go outside, or to a private office, or even go to the restroom. There, using the Great Voice, perform the
        adoration. If need be, you can also visualize your movements instead of physically acting them out.</span></div>

          <span class="bold1">On Tarot Decks</span>
        </span></span></h1>
    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Question 1:</span> I’ve been
          using a Tarot deck that is different than the ones you recommend. Is that okay or do I need to use one of the
          decks you suggest?</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Question 2:</span> I have a
          deck with more [or fewer] cards in the Major [or Minor] Arcana [or fewer or more suits] than “standard” decks.
          Are you saying that I can’t use it?</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Question 3:</span> I love the
          Crowley Thoth Tarot Deck. Why are you saying that I shouldn’t use it?</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">Answer:</span> I’ve linked these questions because
        they can be answered together.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">What I have called a “standard” Tarot deck consists of four suits of
        Minor Arcana cards. Each suit represents one of the four magickal elements: Air, Earth, Fire, or Water. Each
        suit has ten cards numbered from one to ten (often called the “pip” cards) and four face cards often based on
        European royalty (and therefore known as the “court” cards). Traditionally, the numbered cards do not have
        images on them other than a collection of symbols representing the number of the card and its suit. For example,
        the Four of Cups would simply show four cups. The Major Arcana has twenty-two cards numbered from zero to
        twenty-one. Each one has a symbolic image on it.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Although some people have claimed that the Kabalah and the Tarot have
        been linked for thousands of years, it has only been relatively recently that this “ancient link” has been
        established. Even so, that link is incredibly workable and usable, and the binding of the Tarot and the Tree of
        Life has become widely used among magicians. It is part of the system I teach in <span class="italic">Modern
          Magick</span>.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">That is why using a “standard” Tarot deck is important with this
        course. Over the past several decades there has been an incredible increase in the number of Tarot decks
        available. Most, of course, are nothing more than a reinterpretation of the so-called Rider-Waite-Smith Tarot
        (itself a variation on the deck used by members of the Golden Dawn). As such, they will have images on even the
        previously numeric Minor Arcana cards. Although use of such cards is fine, I would remind you that the uses of
        the Tarot in this course are primarily for meditation and Kabalistic Pathworking rather than for giving
        readings. The extra images on the numeric Minor Arcana cards are of no benefit or handicap for this. Meditation
        is done with the Major Arcana cards.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Of the vast number of Tarot decks available, most will work just fine
        with this course. Some decks change the names of the Major Arcana cards or the court cards of the Minor Arcana.
        As long as you can relate them back to the standard terminology, they should present little problem when you use
        them with these lessons.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Other decks add or subtract cards. In some instances the resolution of
        this problem is easy. For example, in <span class="italic">The Golden Dawn Magical Tarot</span> by the Ciceros,
        a second version of one of the Major Arcana cards is included. To use this deck with <span class="italic">Modern
          Magick,</span> simply remove either of the duplicates.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Unfortunately, this method cannot work in all cases. I’ve seen some
        decks that are so unique that they barely relate to the traditional pack and I would question even calling them
        a Tarot deck. For example, I have seen a Minor Arcana composed of eight suits of eight cards each for a total of
        sixty-four. This deck is simply not applicable for work with the system presented here.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">One of the most outstanding and remarkable decks is the one designed
        by Aleister Crowley and realized by Lady Frieda Harris. The painting style has multiple levels. Change the focus
        of your eyes and you can see something entirely different from what you saw moments ago. It is for this exact
        reason that I love to use the <span class="italic">Thoth</span> deck for meditation.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Unfortunately, many people will be surprised at the multiple levels
        revealed by the art on this deck. As a result, I have suggested that people just starting with the Tarot as part
        of this course avoid the Crowley <span class="italic">Thoth</span> deck. This is not because the deck is
        “wrong,” but because its depth may initially confuse. (Recently, a deck published by Lo Scarabeo and called the
        <span class="italic">Initiatory Tarot of the Golden Dawn</span> has been released. It has absolutely brilliant
        art. I’ve seen several Golden Dawn decks, and this has the finest art of any of them. However, it includes a
        pictorial Minor Arcana, which can cause problems. Also, surprisingly, the art is so brilliant that it leaves
        little room for imagination. As a result, this deck is great for doing Golden Dawn and other types of
        divinations, but not as good for Kabalistic Pathworking and meditation. It’s not ideal for beginners with Tarot
        who wish to use a Golden Dawn style of deck for this course.)</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If you are already familiar with the Crowley <span
          class="italic">Thoth</span> Tarot, then go ahead and use it. Be aware, however, that Crowley switched the
        numbers on two of the Major Arcana cards, so for the purpose of this book either reassign them according to the
        associations I have given or study his works so you can understand exactly why he made the changes.</span></div>

          <span class="bold1">On Satanism</span>
        </span></span></h1>
    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Question 1:</span> What do you
          think about Satanism?</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Question 2:</span> What should
          I do for my friend who has been part of a generational Satanic family?</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">Answer:</span> When people talk about Satanism, the
        very name is so filled with emotion and “baggage” that they forget to define what they mean by the very term.
        Most of the people who argue against Satanism tend to equate all forms of Satanism with an imaginary
        organization of baby-killing, insane-eyed sociopaths. Those who defend Satanism frequently equate “real”
        Satanism with a type of self-centered, Ayn Randian philosophy that exalts the individual.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In actuality there are two major types of Satanism. One type is what I
        call “religious Satanists.” They view what they’re doing as a religion. Some of them don’t believe in Satan as
        an entity but use the idea of Satan as an analogy for the supremacy of the individual Will (which,
        unfortunately, is usually interpreted as whatever desire the person has). Others view Satan as a misunderstood
        deity. One group traces Satan back to an Egyptian deity. The thread that runs through most of these religious
        Satanists’ beliefs is a type of Nietzscheism or Ayn Rand Objectivism where the individual, being superior to
        others around him or her, is not bound by conventional ideas of right and wrong. In fact, I read some of the
        semi-secret documents of one of these groups and found that their “ancient” deity actually quoted Nietzsche.
        (Nietzsche’s idea of the “superman” was quite similar to the notion of a superior being who rules over
        inferiors.)</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In practice, most of the people in these groups are law-abiding
        citizens. Often, the leaders of such groups have to be very careful because various law enforcement agencies,
        filled with paranoia and religious propaganda from certain Christian fundamentalist organizations, are looking
        at them to make even the slightest wrong move. Arresting a bunch of Satanists will help politicians get
        re-elected even if the accused committed no crimes.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In most cases, religious Satanists are as upstanding as people in any
        selected group. But with the majority of the Western world having such negative emotions surrounding the very
        term “Satanism,” why would anyone want to identify with a so-called Satanic group, especially when many of them
        don’t even believe in Satan as an entity?</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I can only guess (and my limited experience with Satanists has shown
        this to be accurate) that it is because they are looking for attention or want to spit in society’s eye. Some of
        them seem to think that there is some sort of power in Satanism because so many people hate/fear it. It may stem
        from some sort of feeling of personal powerlessness and the belief that Satanism will give them that desired
        power.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Because there is so much negativity associated with Satanism, deserved
        or not, I suggest that people simply avoid it. That way you will not be drawn into the negativity. If you like
        some of Nietzsche’s ideas, perhaps you’d be better off looking at Rand’s Objectivist philosophy. It is very
        similar to the self-over-all philosophy of some religious Satanists. Curiously, it is also popular among some
        political conservatives who love it if you call it Objectivism but would denounce it if you called the same
        beliefs Satanism.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">There is another type of Satanism, what I call “Self-Styled Satanism,”
        which is a different story. Such Satanic groups usually are small in membership (often only being one or two
        people), don’t advertise and have a leader or leaders who are highly charismatic. They attract people who tend
        to have low self-esteem and are usually highly manipulatable. Why? Because the leaders don’t want a strong
        personality that can stand up to them.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Their “theology” or philosophy varies wildly from group to group. Even
        within a group it may change from day to day at the leader’s whim. These beliefs are frequently made up of
        information culled from cheap movies, bad novels, and a few textbooks. Unfortunately, some of these books are
        ones written by members of other religions and are filled with wild lies in an attempt to vilify an imagined
        Satanism. The Self-Styled Satanist assumes that the impossibly absurd and lurid tales from these books are
        accurate and may actually try to duplicate them, thus proving that the tales were right.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Over the past few decades, there was a growing, then waning, belief in
        the notion of families of Satanists, existing for generations, who have committed horrible crimes. The only
        problem with this is that there has never been any evidence that such groups exist. Supporters of the existence
        of such groups have held on to the stories of various writers even though the tales have proven to be total
        fabrications. Children have been traumatized and families destroyed by politically and/or religiously oriented
        government officials who, according to an FBI agent who investigated the matter, seem more interested in ending
        heresy than solving crimes.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I have no doubt that a person may think that he or she has either been
        part of a generational Satanic family or a victim of one. There is also ample evidence of books, therapists, and
        law enforcement officers who see such activities in situations where it does not exist. Experiments have shown
        that people’s memory of events may be easily altered and people will believe the altered versions with all their
        being.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If you have a friend who believes that he or she has been part of a
        generational Satanic family, I would urge extreme caution on your part. This supposed problem, no matter how
        much the person may believe it accurately reflects an actual past, is merely a symptom of other problems that
        exist in the person’s life. Part of it may be true. None of it may be true. If you get sucked into it, you may
        get pulled into a whirlpool of experiences about which you have incomplete information. This can only lead to
        problems for you.</span></div>

          <span class="bold1">On the Ouija Board</span>
        </span></span></h1>
    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Question:</span> Some friends
          and I have started to work with the Ouija board. We’ve been getting all sorts of interesting information from
          it. But recently somebody told me it was dangerous. What do you think about it?</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">Answer:</span> The Ouija board is a simple plank
        with letters and numbers on it. A three-legged device, known as a <span class="italic">planchette</span>, is
        capable of pointing to the figures on the board. In use, two or more people rest their fingertips lightly on the
        planchette, ask a question, and the device seems to move of its own accord, pointing to the letters and numbers,
        spelling out words and giving information.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This type of device has been known for a long time, although it
        specifically grew out of a method where people would invert a stemmed goblet on a table and use the goblet like
        a planchette. The use of the goblet, in turn, was an advance on table tipping, where people put their fingertips
        on a table and it would lift up and down, tapping out answers to questions.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Skeptics claim that the motion of the planchette, if not fraudulent,
        is caused by “unconscious micro-motor motions” of the muscles of the hands and arms. In fact, that is exactly
        how the planchette moves. No spirit is pushing it around. Unanswered by the skeptics is how the Ouija was able
        to produce information that none of the participants previously had knowledge of.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I think there is evidence to indicate that people can tap into their
        unconscious, or that other entities can work through the unconscious of one or more of the people present, to
        produce messages on the Ouija board. But frankly, I don’t care what the source is. The real questions are, “What
        is the content of the message and what are you going to do about it?”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">This goes into the very nature of the difference between occultism and
        some adherents of the New Age. Some “New Agers” will listen to a message from an unknown source&mdash;what is
        commonly called “channeling”&mdash;and simply because it was channeled they will accept it as truth. Occultists,
        on the other hand, will listen to what the message has to say and then examine it for truth. How does the
        message compare to other information which has previously been verified? Can you confirm the identity of the
        entity claiming to deliver the message via Kabalistic or other means?</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17">
      <div class="calibre19">When I give lectures I usually begin by writing the following letters on a board:<div
          class="calibre20">
          <blockquote class="calibre21">
            <div class="calibre19">
              <div class="calibre12"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">T. F. Y. Q. A.</span></span></div>
            </div>
          </blockquote>
        </div>
        <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">These letters stand for “Think For Yourself, Question Authority.”
        Merely because I or another lecturer says something, or you find something in a book, does not make it a fact.
        Indeed, as self-publishing becomes more prevalent, look for more and more books that are filled with opinion not
        supported by history, tradition, or facts. Currently, one of the most popular purveyors of information on the
        Internet is Wikipedia. Most people don’t look at their disclaimers. For example, as of this writing, they say
        this about the information on their site: “Please be advised that nothing found here has necessarily been
        reviewed by people with the expertise required to provide you with complete, accurate or reliable information .
        . .” No matter the source&mdash;even <span class="italic">Modern Magick</span>&mdash;check everything out for
        yourself.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Consider what will happen if you act on information obtained through a
        Ouija or any other source. If you get a message from the Ouija telling you to do something, I can assure you
        that it is you who will face the consequences of that action, not the force behind the message!</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Is there a potential problem with using a Ouija board? The answer is
        “yes.” While I was editor-in-chief of <span class="italic">FATE</span> magazine I personally did some
        investigation into a case where a Midwestern college dormitory had actually forbidden the use of Ouija boards in
        the dorm! The reason for this, I was told, was because students became so fascinated by the Ouija that their
        schoolwork suffered.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">And that is the real potential problem with the Ouija: not possession
        by an evil entity, not following the words of some demon that lead to damnation, but obsession with the
        seemingly inexplicable movement of the planchette and the messages received.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Therefore, if you want to work with the Ouija, I suggest giving
        yourself limits to the amount of time you spend with it&mdash;perhaps just an hour or two per week. And I also
        suggest that you perform banishing rituals such as the LBRP and BRH before and after its use.</span></div>

        The time you take to create it is, in and of itself, a magickal process that can certainly enhance the effect of
        the talisman. Perhaps, if you have put a great deal of time and energy into the creation of a physical talisman,
        it would be more appropriate to say that the charging or consecrating of the talisman is like turning on a light
        switch. The electricity is always there, but until you complete the circuit by doing the ritual, the light bulb
        doesn’t glow.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The difficulty of answering the first question is that it really
        depends on the capabilities of the magician. An excellent magician could turn a dirty rock into a powerful
        talisman that would overpower anything made by an inexperienced mage. So part of the answer is that it depends
        on who is doing the charging of the talisman.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">In most instances, however, the process of cleansing and charging a
        premade talisman will about equal the effect of constructing a talisman from scratch. The important part is that
        you do the magick.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">A Talisman will bring things to it and an Amulet will keep things
        away. If you have charged one of these devices, having somebody else handle it means that it has been taken away
        from you, weakening its effect on you. Furthermore, the influence of another’s energy pattern, as represented by
        their aura, can also have an effect on your magickal device.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Therefore, as a general rule, after a magickal tool such as a talisman
        has been charged, it should primarily be handled by the person for whom it was created. Obviously, the magician
        charging the talisman will need to handle it to some extent. However, if it is meant for use by someone other
        than the magician, the less the magician handles it after it has been ritually charged, the better.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The easiest way I’ve found to cleanse old talismans and amulets is the
        same as the preparation for new ones. The object can be held under running water and you can visualize all of
        the residual energy flowing away with the water. Another method for cleansing a talisman is to bury it for a few
        days where our gracious Mother Earth can naturally neutralize and absorb all of the object’s energy. Be sure to
        mark where you’ve buried it so you don’t lose it!</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">How do you tell if the talisman has been cleansed? If you have been
        following the course of study and practices given in these lessons, it will have been weeks or months before you
        attempt to make a talisman. During that time you should have been practicing numerous exercises and rituals. One
        of the side effects of doing this is that it enhances your psychic abilities.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">By the time you are ready to charge a talisman your psychic abilities
        should allow you to detect the condition of the object you have chosen for your talisman. After you have
        performed the cleansing, hold the object in your hands and “feel” it&mdash;not just with your physical hands,
        but with your spiritual senses. Does it feel clean to you or does it make you feel that something is lurking
        just under the surface? If the latter, you will want to repeat your cleansing. If the former, the object(s) is
        (are) clean and ready for charging.</span></div>

          <span class="bold1">On the Six-Rayed Star</span>
        </span></span></h1>
    <div class="calibre4">&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Question:</span> In your
          description of the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram (LBRP), you write that one line should be said,
          “Within me shines the six-rayed star.” In</span> The Golden Dawn <span class="italic">by Israel Regardie, he
          says to use “Behind me shines the six-rayed star.” Why the difference and what is the significance of the
          six-rayed star?</span></span></div>
    <div class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre5" /></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">Answer:</span> Regardie’s The <span
          class="italic">Golden Dawn</span> is an invaluable resource tool for the practicing magician. Like the
        grimoires that came before it, however, much of the book is only notes intended for a student’s use. In <span
          class="italic">The Golden Dawn</span>, the LBRP is “explained” in a page, while in the first edition of <span
          class="italic">Modern Magick</span> I took almost fifteen pages, spread over two lessons, to explain the
        ritual. Why is this?</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If you had received the notes for the ritual of the LBRP, such as are
        printed in <span class="italic">The Golden Dawn</span>, it was expected that you would be instructed in how to
        use them by another member. Regardie’s book does not explain why they use those particular words. Neither his
        book nor these lessons went into great depth on this subject.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The reason I didn’t go into detail is that I hoped people would use
        <span class="italic">Modern Magick</span> as both a study guide and resource tool. As such, it could be used as
        follows:</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Look on the Kabalistic correspondence chart from Lesson 3. You will
        see that the number 6 corresponds to such things as the Sun, the Sephira Tiferet, and the heart. In a very real
        sense, this is the “love” center on the Tree of Life, the source of spreading warmth from our hearts, our
        internal suns. That “warmth” is the strength of love.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">As I also explained, if you want to relate the Tree of Life to the
        human body, you must imagine yourself backing into it.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">When you verbalize the phrase “the six-rayed star” while you perform
        the LBRP, you hold your body such that the spine is straight and the arms are extended out to either side. It
        physically makes you the center of the universe: a blending of the physical (the outspread arms reaching to the
        elements of our universe) and the spiritual (the vertical body receiving power from the Divine). It all meets in
        the love center, Tiferet, the heart. Later, you will fold your hands directly over this power center.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Thus, this passage is an acknowledgment and recognition that the
        representation of the Tree of Life on Earth is the physical body of every human being. Where is the central
        point of that Tree? If you are backing into it, that central point is behind you: “Behind me shines the
        six-rayed star.” If you can recognize that you and the Tree are one, then that star is inside you: “Within me
        shines the six-rayed star.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">I used the term “within” rather than “behind” because I believe it
        provides a stronger, more accurate, and intense image. I have seen another version that says, “Above me shines
        the six-rayed star.” You might find the Golden Dawn’s version, or any other version, more effective for
        you.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Magick, in order to survive and grow, needs to evolve as humanity
        evolves. However, I do not support change for change’s sake. If you have a logical and emotional reason for
        making a change, go ahead. Because I had a good reason to change it on psychological, mystical, and
        image-oriented grounds, I feel that the version I provided in these lessons is valid.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">Answer:</span> While I thank you for your kind

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">If I were to do magick for you, I would be abandoning everything these

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">It may very well be that magick will be able to help you. Start at
        Lesson One and work your way through these lessons, taking about a month for each one. I have no doubt that if

    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">(<span class="italic">Author’s Note</span>: When I created this
        bibliography, and the bibliographies for each lesson, during the writing of the first edition of <span
          class="italic">Modern Magick</span>, I tried to be as thorough as possible, giving the dates and publishers
        for the editions of books I owned. As a collector of occult books, I knew that many people would be unable to
        obtain the editions I listed and some of the books I included were long out-of-print and difficult, expensive,
        or impossible to obtain. I have to admit that in some ways it was an egotistical attempt to show off my personal
        library and I am glad to say that I have grown beyond that. In order to be more practical and truly useful, this
        bibliography, and those at the end of each lesson, now include the most current publishers and publication dates
        at the time this is being written rather than the dates and publishers of the editions in my library. I have
        also tried to eliminate most books that are out-of-print at the time of this writing. Any books that are
        out-of-print and are included have been listed because of their importance, and thanks to the Internet,
        obtaining such books is much easier than when <span class="italic">Modern Magick</span> was originally
        published. And before anyone asks, sorry, but my collection is not a lending library.)</span></div>

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">The above four books compose the major corpus of Bardon’s works. He
        has his own theories which are not totally in line with most of traditional Western occultism. Still, many
        authors “borrow” from Bardon without giving him credit. See, for example, his concept of “fluid condensers.”
        <span class="italic">Frabato</span> is primarily a loosely disguised autobiography and is well worth reading.
        Unfortunately, these books are translations from the original German, and can be difficult to wade through, but
        the effort to do so will be well rewarded.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Berg, Philip S. <span class="italic">The Wheels of a Soul.</span>
        Kabalah Publishing, 2004. Kosher Kabalah explanation of reincarnation. I liked some of Berg’s earlier books, but
        I do not recommend many of them today, nor his more recent ones, because some people consider his organization,
        The Kabalah Centre, to be cultic. When I visited their Los Angeles site, a woman who greeted me spent most of
        her time trying to get me to spend hundreds of dollars on books in Hebrew. She told me it didn’t matter if I
        couldn’t read Hebrew because they’d send me information on how to simply look at the pages to get

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Most books on astral projection have an orientation on achieving
        projection within a few days. This book and CD set slows the process down to let you achieve and master astral
        projection over a three-month period. If other systems didn’t work for you, this one might.</span></div>

          Writings of Aleister Crowley.</span> Weiser Books, 1986. At one time this was <span class="italic">the</span>
        must-have dictionary of Western Occultism. It’s been superseded by other, more complete books by Godwin and
        Skinner, but it is familiar to so many magicians that it is still a popular resource.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. <span class="italic">The Book of Lies.</span>
        Weiser Books, 1986. A delightfully playful exploration into the theories and practices of magick, often highly
        disguised. An advanced book not because of the content, but because you need to be able to see through the codes
        and blinds to understand it.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.<span class="italic">The Book of Thoth.</span>
        Weiser, 1988. Crowley’s last book published while he was alive, it shows that contrary to the claims of those
        who dislike him, his mind was still sharp, his memory fine, and he was highly creative. More than an exposition
        of the Tarot in general and his <span class="italic">Thoth Tarot</span> specifically, it’s also a great
        introduction to Kabalah and Thelema.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. <span class="italic">The Confessions of
          Aleister Crowley.</span> Penguin, 1989. Whether or not you are interested in magick, his
        autobiography&mdash;he called it an <span class="italic">autohagiography</span> , the autobiography of a
        saint&mdash;stands as one of his most readable and enjoyable works. Crowley went through various phases in his
        life, and was always writing. It can be misleading to pick up a book by Crowley and assume it is the essence of
        his writings on a subject without knowing how he was evolving when it was written. I would contend that it is
        impossible to understand Crowley without knowing his life. Get this book, the “Hag” as he called it, or a
        biography of his life.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. <span class="italic">Eight Lectures on
          Yoga.</span> New Falcon Publications, 1992. Simply the best introduction to the theory of yoga ever written.
        Also known as “Yoga for Yahoos.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. <span class="italic">Gems From the
          Equinox.</span> Weiser Books, 2007. From 1909 to 1913, Crowley published eleven enormous volumes of a
        “journal” called “The Equinox.” Each was the size of a large book.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">Most of each was written by Crowley, often using numerous pseudonyms.
        They included poetry, book reviews, and other bits of snarky contemporaneous comments that are irrelevant today.
        Within that, however, were incredible amounts of important spiritual information and magickal ritual. Israel
        Regardie collected, for magically oriented people, the important parts of those books in this one volume. An
        important addition to any occultist’s library.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. <span class="italic">The Goetia: The Lesser Key
          of Solomon the King</span>. Weiser Books, 1995. Although Crowley generally gets the credit for this, he
        actually did little work on it. Mathers is called the “translator,” which is weird because the originals are in
        English! Crowley is listed as the “editor,” but he didn’t do much at all. He wrote a brief introduction
        (minimizing Mathers’ work), added a few footnotes, and at the end, added a section with an interlinear
        translation of the evocations into Enochian. After it was published in England the book pirate L.W. de Laurence
        printed an unauthorized version in the U.S. He included the added section in the back, but instead of having the
        Enochian below the English, he simply put the same English under the English. When I first saw this, not knowing
        the history, it confused me to no end. There are more complete versions and ones with more notes and
        explanations, but this is the version that has been used by more magicians than any other. It’s a basic and good
        resource.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. <span class="italic">The Law is for All.</span>
        Thelema Media, 1996. For those into Crowley, his most important work. Contains <span class="italic">The Book of
          the Law</span>, the key work for Thelemic thought, and two commentaries on it.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. <span class="italic">Magick</span>. Weiser,
        1998. Although episodic, disconnected, and occasionally having blinds, still an excellent introduction to
        ceremonial magick ranging from beginning to advanced. Also includes Thelemic concepts interwoven in the text.
        Not a book to be read so much as studied. A brilliant exposition of <span class="italic">Magick in Theory and
          Practice</span>.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. <span class="italic">Magick Without
          Tears</span>. New Falcon Publications, 1991. Crowley’s most simple and clear book on magick. Although episodic
        and disjointed, it attempts to respond to questions he was asked. Explains topics not covered in his other
        books.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Crowley, Aleister, and Samuel Mathers. <span class="italic">The

        Llewellyn Publications, 2001.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">These four books are a wonderful introduction to natural magick. The

          Solitary Practitioner.</span> Llewellyn Publications, 1993. Gerald Gardner is given credit for restarting (or
        starting) modern Wicca as a social, coven-oriented form. When this book originally appeared in 1988, it shifted
        into high gear a revolution resulting in the primary form of Wicca today, a religion followed by solitary
        practitioners who are not part of a coven structure. My friend Scott played his last joke on me when passed to
        the Summerland on my birthday in 1993. Now, I can’t celebrate a birthday without thinking of him. He needn’t
        have worried&mdash;I’ll always remember my good friend. He is greatly missed by me and by many tens of thousands
        of his fans. He may be the most beloved writer on Wicca ever.</span></div>

    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. <span class="italic">Practical Guide to
          Creative Visualization</span>. Llewellyn, 2002. If you have read these lessons, you know I am not a fan of
        exclusively using creative visualization. Rather, I think it should be a part of Kabalistic Mental Magick.
        Still, it’s a good idea to learn this aspect of the more complete system, and to that end this is one of the
        better books on the subject.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. <span class="italic">Practical Guide to Psychic
          Self-Defense</span>. Llewellyn, 2002. One of the best books available on the subject, period. There is none of
        the usual paranoia found in other books of this sort and it has usable, practical techniques for the magickal
        practitioner.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Douglas, Nik, and Penny Slinger. <span class="italic">Sexual
          Secrets.</span> Destiny Books, 1999. This book is held in high esteem by many as an introduction to Tantric
        and Taoist sexuality. I find this curious, as it has relatively little information but lots of illustrations.
        The illustrations are beautifully done, but I find it odd that I didn’t see any credits for the original photos
        on which they were based.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Dukes, Ramsey (originally published using the pseudonym Lemuel
        Johnstone). <span class="italic">SSOTBME Revised.</span> The Mouse That Spins, 2002. This book had a powerful
        impact on me as a young man when it first appeared in 1975. It seemed like a magickal drug trip, where the words
        seemed to go round and round but took you to new concepts and ways of thinking. No wonder Dukes influenced the
        Chaos Magick movement.</span></div>

        Llewellyn Publications, 2005.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">These two books are the starting points for Postmodern Magick, a
        system which blends all of the latest concepts in magick into a theoretical and practical whole. If they catch
        on, they are clearly the future of magick moving into the twenty-first century. Popularity, however, is fickle,
        and only time will tell how important these books are. People doubted me when I raved about <span
          class="italic">SSOTBME</span> and <span class="italic">Liber Null</span>. I hope you won’t feel left behind if
        you don’t discover the concepts behind Postmodern Magick.</span></div>

          Lamed Ben Clifford.</span> Weiser Books, 2001. A wonderful and intuitive introduction to concepts of the

        advanced students.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. <span class="italic">The Magick of Aleister
          Crowley.</span> Weiser Books, 2003. Crowley’s books are sometimes difficult to understand. This book brings a

        cadet,” or how to bring yourself down to Earth. The second, like Crowley’s <span class="italic">Magick Without

        Not one of my favorites by her, but still valuable for extra study.</span></div>

        Three Rivers Press, 1983. An introduction to Tantric sexuality that has been very popular over the years. It is
        good, but it doesn’t reach a level of excellence as Garrison was not initiated into any Tantric traditions and
        didn’t understand the inner concepts and secrets. Still, in my opinion it’s better than most on the

    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">These books by Grant are listed in the order they were originally
        published because to understand them requires knowing what he previously wrote. These books claim to be an
        expansion on Crowley’s works. Certainly they take sex magick and the concept of dealing with non-physical
        entities far beyond anything in this course. It’s advanced work and, to some people, downright weird and even
        frightening. Many people, including F. I. Regardie, disagree with Grant’s theories and the techniques he hints
        at. His use of language is precise but often as difficult to understand as his seeming pride at “tangential
        tantrums,” physical results of rituals that go horribly wrong. Is this fiction? Metaphor? Reality? Whatever
        these books are, they have influenced many contemporary occultists, although I find more people talk about his
        books than have actually read them.</span></div>

        Publications, 1999. There are lots of books on the chakras. Most of them are by channelers, IROBs, or people who
        studied with channelers and IROBs. This book is different. It goes back to classic sources, and is well
        researched and very practical. In short, if you want to know about the chakras and don’t want to wade through a
        bunch of books from India or questionable Western titles, this is the book to study.</span></div>

        Weiser, 1997. Many translations and commentaries on this small book are available. This is simply the best one
        ever published. In my opinion, the <span class="italic">Sefer Yetzirah</span> is a crossover text between
        earlier mysticism and Kabalah. Some consider it the first book of the Kabalah. There are smaller and less
        expensive editions of this book that are in print, but as a magician, this is the one you should get and
        study.</span></div>

          class="italic">Eye</span> was a rare book. Now there is an entire cottage industry that has developed around
        the “Five Tibetans.” I have a rare book from the same year this was first published without the silly story at

        if he had read this, and he said that he had read many of Kuhn’s books, and this was the only one worthwhile.
        That was good enough for me. Although I was fascinated by this book, I never looked at his other works.</span>

        Books, 1973. When Western Theosophists found out that one of the chakras was associated with the sexual organs,
        they almost went into apoplexy. So they switched it to the spleen(!). Read this to see how the Theosophists were

        one of the first books to compare Western sex magick with Eastern Tantric sexuality. Now, it is expanded to be
        one of the finest books available on Tantra. The author of the lessons you are reading wrote a chapter that is
        included in this book.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Omega, Kane. <span class="italic">Cosmic Sex</span>. Lyle Stuart,
        Inc., 1973. Although long out of print, this humorous autobiographical introduction to Tantra will teach you

        best introductions to astral projection around. I always got the feeling that Ophiel was not very smart, so he
        wrote the way he wished things would be written: clear enough so that even he could understand them. As a
        result, anyone can use them. If you’re having trouble with astral projection, try the techniques in this book.
        His out-of-print book, <span class="italic">The Art &amp; Practice of Getting Material Things Through Creative
          Visualization,</span> has a horribly unwieldy title and isn’t as famous as some of the other books on that

        his best efforts. His others range from average to embarrassingly bad. I have no idea how an editor let them get
        published. Perhaps an early example of the curse of self-publishing.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Patai, Raphael. <span class="italic">The Hebrew Goddess.</span> Wayne
        State University Press, 1990. This is a much-beloved book by Pagans. It clearly shows that the ancient Hebrews

        occultist’s library.</span></div>

        Llewellyn Publications, 2006. Although the title implies that you can do things instantly, the real meaning is

          Solomon.</span> Weiser Books, 2001.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre7">These two books by Peterson are absolute classics, some of the best
        researched and presented versions of these two grimoires.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Pike, Albert. <span class="italic">Morals and Dogma</span>. Forgotten
        Books, 2008. The most famous text of mystical Masonry. Filled with mystical wisdom intended for Freemasons, but
        applicable to anyone on a spiritual path. The old style of writing may be difficult, but it’s worth it.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Pollack, Rachel<span class="italic">. Rachel Pollack’s Tarot
          Wisdom.</span> Llewellyn, 2008. This is an all-around great book on the Tarot, with history, spreads,
        interpretation keys, and wisdom gained from her years of study and teaching. There are lots of good introductory
        books on Tarot. This is one you should study after you’ve read those introductions.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Prasad, Rama. <span class="italic">Nature’s Finer Forces</span>.
        Kessinger Publishing, 1997. The little-known book is a classic book of Tantric Indian occultism. Although the
        Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn was a Western magickal order, they used a small amount of Eastern concepts.
        Practically everything they used was taken from this book.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Raphael. <span class="italic">Raphael’s Ancient Manuscript of
          Talismanic Magic</span>. Kessinger Publishing, 1942(?). A source book for making talismans. Handwritten in the
        form of a grimoire.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Ready, Romilla, and Kate Burton<span class="italic">. Neuro-Linguistic
          Programming for Dummies.</span> For Dummies, 2004. This was the textbook used when I trained to become a
        certified practitioner of NLP in 2008. (I’m currently certified as a master practitioner of NLP by the
        Association for Integrative Psychology. My main trainer was Dr. Matthew James, son of Tad James.) NLP is a young
        science, and it’s amazing how fast it’s evolving. Some of the ideas presented in this book were already obsolete
        when I took my trainings. Still, this will give you the basic concepts of NLP.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Regardie, Israel. <span class="italic">Ceremonial Magic.</span> Aeon
        books, 2004. Although the Watchtower ritual first appeared in this book, it was edited out of its obvious order
        that was taught to me by one of Regardie’s students. Still, its value for learning about magick and the concepts
        of that ritual shouldn’t be overlooked.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. <span class="italic">Foundations of Practical
          Magic.</span> Aeon Books, 2004. A collection of small booklets by Regardie that are unmatched in their clarity
        in discussing several occult topics.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. <span class="italic">A Garden of
          Pomegranates.</span> Llewellyn Publications, 1995. A good explanation of the Kabalah.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. <span class="italic">The Golden Dawn.</span>
        Llewellyn Publications, 2002. The classic text of Western occultism. Probably copied directly or indirectly by
        more writers than any other occult book . . . usually without giving credit.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. <span class="italic">How to Make and Use
          Talismans.</span> Thorsons, 1983. Simple but clear little book on this topic from a ceremonial magick point of
        view. Probably the best individual book on this subject. As of this writing it is regrettably out of print. If
        you can find a copy, get it.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. <span class="italic">The Middle Pillar.</span>
        Llewellyn Publications, 2002. This book has become the source book for information on the Middle Pillar Ritual.
        Now used by many “ancient” traditions as well as modern ones.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. <span class="italic">The One Year
          Manual.</span> Red Wheel/Weiser, 2007. A system of spiritual development that can be powerful, especially if
        you read between the lines.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. <span class="italic">The Tree of Life.</span>
        Llewellyn Publications, 2000. A much ignored book on magickal theory and practice due to its difficulty. Also
        discusses alchemy and sex magick. Regardie was clearly under the influence of his teacher and mentor (and maybe
        father figure?), Aleister Crowley, when writing this book.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Reich, Wilhelm. <span class="italic">The Function of the
          Orgasm.</span> Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 1986. A book that blends science and sex magick. When I talked to
        Regardie about this book he agreed with me that all magicians should study it. Of course, he was a Reichian
        therapist, so he may have been prejudiced.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Rowe, Benjamin. <span class="italic">Enochian Temples.</span> Black
        Moon Publishing, 2008. Although in these lessons I only slightly mentioned Enochian magick, those who are really
        interested in the subject tend to focus on the original writings of Dee and try to reproduce his work. The late
        Mr. Rowe wrote several brief (this “book” is only thirty-eight pages) monographs that expand on the Enochian
        system and imaginatively move it into the future. All of his works are highly recommended for advanced
        practitioners.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Saraswati, Swami Janakananda. <span class="italic">Yoga, Tantra and
          Meditation in Daily Life.</span> Weiser, 1992. I purchased this book when it first came out in the mid-1970s,
        in part because I was a hormonal young man and there were pictures of a naked woman in it. But very quickly, I
        was confused. What did nudity have to do with meditation? And how did meditation and yoga relate to Tantra? This
        is a small book and I learned a great deal from it. The author is out of a Tantric tradition where everyone
        takes the last name “Saraswati.” Most of the writers in this tradition are published by the Bihar School of
        Yoga, and I recommend their publications highly.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Shaw, Scott. <span class="italic">Chi Kung for Beginners.</span>
        Llewellyn Publications, 2004. I first started taking lessons in chi kung via mail order about thirty years ago.
        I quickly realized that it was a way to work with the same energies used in magick. As such, the practice of chi
        kung is a great way to learn how to develop and become familiar with this energy. Shaw’s book is an excellent
        introduction to chi kung. It’s clear and easy to use, but don’t let that fool you. The practice of chi kung can
        give you great personal power.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Sheba, Lady (pseud. of J. W. Bell). <span class="italic">The Grimoire
          of Lady Sheba.</span> Llewellyn, 2001. An excellent, if controversial, introduction to what is primarily
        Gardnerian Witchcraft.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Sherwin, Ray. <span class="italic">The Book of Results</span>. LULU,
        2005. One of the key books for Chaos magicians. It helped turn the focus of magick to results rather than
        method. Some people even refer to Chaos Magick as “results magick.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Skinner, Stephen. <span class="italic">The Complete Magician’s
          Tables.</span> Llewellyn Publications, 2007. This is the most complete book to date for magicians looking for
        lists of correspondences with which to design rituals, talismans, etc. Just as Godwin’s book superseded
        Crowley’s <span class="italic">777</span>, this book can replace Godwin. Personally, I have all three. They each
        have their uses. This, however, is currently the ultimate guide for designing magickal rituals, talismans,
        amulets, etc.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. <span class="italic">Veritable Key of
          Solomon.</span> Llewellyn, 2008. A fantastic and perhaps the most complete version of what is commonly known
        as the <span class="italic">Greater Key of Solomon</span>. Another must-read.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Skinner, Stephen, and David Rankine. <span class="italic">The Goetia
          of Dr. Rudd.</span> Golden Hoard Press, 2007. This is perhaps the ultimate current edition of the <span
          class="italic">Goetia</span>. We should thank Skinner and Rankine for their hard work on these volumes.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Spare, Austin Osman. <span class="italic">The Writings of Austin Osman
          Spare</span>. NuVision Publications, 2007. Features his theories and ideas. A key book for those looking for
        background to the Chaos Magick movement, as well as a means to improve their magickal practices.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Sperling, Harry, Maurice Simon, and Paul Levertoff (translators).
        <span class="italic">The Zohar</span> (5 volumes). Soincino Press, 1984. The <span class="italic">Zohar</span>
        is one of the key documents of the Kabalah, and this is one of the most complete English translations available.
        A must for those who wish to puzzle over the mysteries of the Kosher Kabalah.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Starhawk. <span class="italic">The Spiral Dance.</span> HarperOne,
        1999. A feminist and political view of the history and rebirth of Witchcraft in the modern era.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Sterling, Stephen. <span class="italic">Tarot Awareness.</span>
        Llewellyn, 2000. Examines the spiritual and practical sides of the Tarot. A great book for people looking for
        more information on the cards.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Stockham, Alice. <span class="italic">Karezza.</span> Forgotten Books,
        2008. One of the most valuable books for potential male sex magicians, and for their partners. It teaches the
        value of extending sexual activity.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Tyson, Donald. <span class="italic">Enochian Magic for
          Beginners.</span> Llewellyn Publications, 2002. There are very few books that are beginners’ guides to the
        Enochian system, but Tyson’s book is the one decent one that I would recommend. I disagree with some of Tyson’s
        philosophy&mdash;I don’t think working Enochian magick is going to bring on the Christian apocalypse&mdash;but
        on a practical level this book is a great introduction.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Valiente, Doreen. <span class="italic">An ABC of Witchcraft Past and
          Present.</span> Phoenix Publishing, 1988. Set up a bit like an encyclopedia with an alphabetical listing of
        entries, this book is an excellent overview of Witchcraft when it was first published in 1973. Today it is an
        important historical document for people to learn about Wicca at that time, but Witchcraft has moved on.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. <span class="italic">Witchcraft for
          Tomorrow.</span> Robert Hale, 1993. Originally published in 1978, a great introduction to Wicca as it was
        practiced thirty years ago by one of the most respected women in all of Paganism, and the author of the famous
        “Charge of the Goddess.”</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Vitimus, Andrieh. <span class="italic">Hands-On Chaos Magic.</span>
        Llewellyn Publications, 2009. Not just a good introduction to Chaos Magick, but a practical introduction to its
        techniques. A good starting book for those interested in Chaos Magick.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Waite, A. E. <span class="italic">The Book of Ceremonial Magic</span>.
        Cosimo Classics, 2007. A famous source book of sections from grimoires purposely designed to be unusable.
        Virtually the same as his <span class="italic">The Book of Black Magic and of Pacts</span>, so don’t get them
        both.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Wang, Robert. <span class="italic">The Qabalistic Tarot.</span> Marcus
        Aurelius Press, 2004. The most brilliant introduction to the Tarot from a Kabalistic viewpoint that I’ve ever
        read. Also a good introduction to Kabalah in general.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. <span class="italic">The Secret Temple.</span>
        Marcus Aurelius Press, 1993. Although some of his ideas are flawed, this is a simple and direct book giving
        instructions on how to build the basic magickal tools and a Golden Dawn-style temple.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Weed, Joseph. <span class="italic">Wisdom of the Mystic
          Masters.</span> Prentice Hall Press, 1971. If you’ve been around occult-oriented magazines for more than a few
        years, you’ve seen the ads for the Rosicrucian Order, AMORC. This book features the core of their
        teachings.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Westcott, W. Wynn. <span class="italic">The Complete Golden Dawn
          Cipher Manuscript.</span> Holmes Publishing Group, 1996. A high-quality and meticulously researched (by editor
        Darcy Kuntz) printing and translation of the documents that are responsible for founding the Hermetic Order of
        the Golden Dawn. Great for historical reference and for seeing how Mathers took the simple concepts and expanded
        them into full-blown rituals and informational lectures.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Williams, Brandy. <span class="italic">Ecstatic Ritual.</span>
        Megalithica Books, 2008. A unique book on sex magick in that it comes from a woman’s point of view and is also
        based in ceremonial magick.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Winkler, Gershon. <span class="italic">The Soul of the Matter.</span>
        Judaica Press, 1982. A simple explanation of Kosher Kabalistic theories of reincarnation.</span></div>
    <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Within, Inquire (pseud of Christina Stoddard). <span
          class="italic">Light-Bearers of Darkness</span>. Christian Book Club of America, 1983. Now rare and difficult
        to find, this is a history of the Golden Dawn by a one-time member who turned against the order and became a
        hate-filled, paranoid anti-Semite. It was thought that she was going to be a great adept, and she was rushed
        through the degrees without having the time to really absorb the mystical energies of each grade. An example of
        what can happen if you do not spend time and earn your advancement rather than just being given a wide range of
        information.</span></div>

            time. However, without understanding them, the symbols on these cards may falsely appear as being negative,
            and contemplating them without understanding them could result in the imprinting of false or negative
            beliefs and ideas. As you learn more of the Tarot in the weeks to come, these cards will be returned and
            used in this ritual.</span></div>

        <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">It is unlikely that the ancient Hebrews were ever actually
            enslaved by the Egyptians. There is no evidence that the Egyptians ever had such forms of slavery. It is
            more likely that they were simply an ethnic tribe within the control of Egypt. This is brought to light even
            in the story of the exodus where the Hebrews took their animals and possessions with them, and not long
            after melting their possessions of gold to form an idol. The concept of slavery is one where the slaves are
            possessions. They have nothing of their own. How could they have taken possessions, including lots of gold,
            when they would have had no possessions? It is clear that while the story of the Exodus may have some
            factual elements, much of it is mythologized.</span></div>

        <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">This is the “standard” story about the kundalini. Just recently I
            saw a post on an online forum from a person reading, “If this force awakens in an impure or out of balance
            form it can result in evil genius fanaticism delusions of grandeur, or mental illness (like manic depression
            and schizophrenia).” In recent years I’ve come to believe that this type of paranoia is far beyond a
            misinterpretation and may not be true at all. However, that discussion does not belong in this book and is
            more appropriate for a book on Tantra.</span></div>

        <div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7">Before publication I learned that this concept actually originated
            with Paul Valéry (1871-1945). He wrote in an essay, “In the eyes of those who anxiously seek perfection, a
            work is never truly completed&mdash;a word that for them has no sense&mdash;but abandoned; and this
            abandonment, of the book to the fire or to the public, whether due to weariness or to a need to deliver it
            for publication, is a sort of accident, comparable to the letting go of an idea that has become so tiring or
            annoying that one has lost all interest in it.” Other versions have included “A poem is never finished, only
            abandoned,” also attributed to Valéry, but never written by him, and “A painting is never finished, only
            abandoned,” attributed to a variety of people including Picasso.</span></div>
